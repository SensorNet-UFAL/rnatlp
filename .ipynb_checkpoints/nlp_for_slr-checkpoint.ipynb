From standard smart homes to automated buildings, includingother kind of domotics and inmotics solutions, every system must betested and validated before its installation. The current tools offeredby IoT and home automation vendors lack in emulation features close tothe real behavior of the devices. In many cases, delaying theverification actions until the hardware is acquired and installed maycause some drawbacks, for example, from the economic point of view. Thispaper presents a solution for emulating home automation environmentswhich are based on the KNX standard and can be represented byarchitectures of devices. The emulation consist of developing virtualimplementations of real devices which operate and communicate throughweb technology. The technology implementing these virtual devices allowsus to develop components which can provide different type of datarelated to the installation (audio, video, text, animations, images,etc.). The architectures can be managed using web services and theirbehavior can be tested through web user interfaces showing the mentioneddata. Furthermore, virtual and physical devices are connected tovalidate the interoperability between the real installation and theemulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper,we propose a solution to the problem of jointly optimizing the code anddata size when converting SDF programs into software implementations.We consider two approaches. The first is a customization to acyclicgraphs of a bottom-up technique, called pairwise grouping of adjacentnodes (PGAN), that was proposed earlier for general SDF graphs. We showthat our customization to acyclic graphs significantly reduces thecomplexity of the general PGAN algorithm, and we present a formal studyof our modified PGAN technique that rigorously establishes itsoptimality for a certain class of applications. The second approach thatwe consider is a top-down technique, based on a generalized minimum-cutoperation, that was introduced recently in {[}14]. We present theresults of an extensive experimental investigation on the performance ofour modified PGAN technique and the top-down approach and on thetradeoffs between them. Based on these results, we conclude that thesetwo techniques complement each other, and thus, they should both beincorporated into SDF-based software implementation environments inwhich the minimization of memory requirements is important.

From standard smart homes to automated buildings, includingother kind of domotics and inmotics solutions, every system must betested and validated before its installation. The current tools offeredby IoT and home automation vendors lack in emulation features close tothe real behavior of the devices. In many cases, delaying theverification actions until the hardware is acquired and installed maycause some drawbacks, for example, from the economic point of view. Thispaper presents a solution for emulating home automation environmentswhich are based on the KNX standard and can be represented byarchitectures of devices. The emulation consist of developing virtualimplementations of real devices which operate and communicate throughweb technology. The technology implementing these virtual devices allowsus to develop components which can provide different type of datarelated to the installation (audio, video, text, animations, images,etc.). The architectures can be managed using web services and theirbehavior can be tested through web user interfaces showing the mentioneddata. Furthermore, virtual and physical devices are connected tovalidate the interoperability between the real installation and theemulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

       "| Emulating home automation installations through component-based webtechnology | 10.1016/j.future.2017.09.062 | 2019 | Emulating home automation installations through component-based webtechnology The Internet of Things mechanisms enable the management of homeenvironments since they can be developed as IoT based informationsystems. From standard smart homes to automated buildings, includingother kind of domotics and inmotics solutions, every system must betested and validated before its installation. The current tools offeredby IoT and home automation vendors lack in emulation features close tothe real behavior of the devices. In many cases, delaying theverification actions until the hardware is acquired and installed maycause some drawbacks, for example, from the economic point of view. Thispaper presents a solution for emulating home automation environmentswhich are based on the KNX standard and can be represented byarchitectures of devices. The emulation consist of developing virtualimplementations of real devices which operate and communicate throughweb technology. The technology implementing these virtual devices allowsus to develop components which can provide different type of datarelated to the installation (audio, video, text, animations, images,etc.). The architectures can be managed using web services and theirbehavior can be tested through web user interfaces showing the mentioneddata. Furthermore, virtual and physical devices are connected tovalidate the interoperability between the real installation and theemulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We showthat our customization to acyclic graphs significantly reduces thecomplexity of the general PGAN algorithm, and we present a formal studyof our modified PGAN technique that rigorously establishes itsoptimality for a certain class of applications.

Thearchitecture relies on mature methods and technology only. Inparticular, it includes a highly ergonomic but rigorous validationmethod, called diverse back translation. For safety-related programcontrolled electronic systems, safety licensing of software is extremelycritical, since it is far from being as dependable as hardware.

Ourmethod uses ABC, a sequential circuit synthesis and verificationframework, to (1) generate an efficient circuit implementation of thesystem that can be readily translated into FPGA or ASIC implementationsand to (2) verify the system and debug it in case a counterexample isfound. Moreover, we generate a concurrent C implementation of thecircuit that can be directly used for runtime verification. We evaluatedour method with two benchmark systems, and our results show that,compared to existing techniques, our method is faster and scales tolarger sizes.

       "30   Emulating home automation installations through component-based webtechnology The Internet of Things mechanisms enable the management of homeenvironments since they can be developed as IoT based informationsystems. From standard smart homes to automated buildings, includingother kind of domotics and inmotics solutions, every system must betested and validated before its installation. The current tools offeredby IoT and home automation vendors lack in emulation features close tothe real behavior of the devices. In many cases, delaying theverification actions until the hardware is acquired and installed maycause some drawbacks, for example, from the economic point of view. Thispaper presents a solution for emulating home automation environmentswhich are based on the KNX standard and can be represented byarchitectures of devices. The emulation consist of developing virtualimplementations of real devices which operate and communicate throughweb technology. The technology implementing these virtual devices allowsus to develop components which can provide different type of datarelated to the installation (audio, video, text, animations, images,etc.). The architectures can be managed using web services and theirbehavior can be tested through web user interfaces showing the mentioneddata.

The synchronous dataflow (SDF) model isparticularly well-suited to dataflow-based graphical programming becauseits restricted semantics offer strong formal properties and significantcompile-time predictability, while capturing the behavior of a largeclass of important signal processing applications. When synthesizingsoftware for embedded signal processing applications, criticalconstraints arise due to the limited amounts of memory. In this paper,we propose a solution to the problem of jointly optimizing the code anddata size when converting SDF programs into software implementations.We consider two approaches. The first is a customization to acyclicgraphs of a bottom-up technique, called pairwise grouping of adjacentnodes (PGAN), that was proposed earlier for general SDF graphs. We showthat our customization to acyclic graphs significantly reduces thecomplexity of the general PGAN algorithm, and we present a formal studyof our modified PGAN technique that rigorously establishes itsoptimality for a certain class of applications. The second approach thatwe consider is a top-down technique, based on a generalized minimum-cutoperation, that was introduced recently in {[}14]. We present theresults of an extensive experimental investigation on the performance ofour modified PGAN technique and the top-down approach and on thetradeoffs between them.

The first is a customization to acyclicgraphs of a bottom-up technique, called pairwise grouping of adjacentnodes (PGAN), that was proposed earlier for general SDF graphs. We showthat our customization to acyclic graphs significantly reduces thecomplexity of the general PGAN algorithm, and we present a formal studyof our modified PGAN technique that rigorously establishes itsoptimality for a certain class of applications. The second approach thatwe consider is a top-down technique, based on a generalized minimum-cutoperation, that was introduced recently in {[}14]. We present theresults of an extensive experimental investigation on the performance ofour modified PGAN technique and the top-down approach and on thetradeoffs between them. Based on these results, we conclude that thesetwo techniques complement each other, and thus, they should both beincorporated into SDF-based software implementation environments inwhich the minimization of memory requirements is important.

However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication. We present an algorithm that transforms component-baseddesign spaces, expressible in CoDeL, to an SMT program, which, solved bystate-of-the-art SMT solvers, determines the satisfiability of thesynthesis problem, and delivers a correct-by-construction systemconfiguration. Evaluation results for use cases in the domain ofscheduling and mapping of distributed real-time processes confirm,first, the performance gain of SMT compared to traditional design spaceexploration approaches, second, the usability gains by expressing designproblems in CoDeL, and third, the capability of the CoDeL/SMT approachto support the design of embedded systems.

As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess. To demonstrate these capabilities, the methodology is testedwith two large examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While technologyexists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-basedapplications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools.Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very fewexisting and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution todevelopers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integratedmodel-driven development environment that addresses all phases ofapplication lifecycle including design, development, verification,analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, withsupporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such amodel-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, thispaper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMSML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specificsub-languages. We claim that the language promotes``correct-by-construction{''} software development and integration bysupporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle. Using acase study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS ML impacts thedevelopment of embedded systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in {[}1]). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas.

The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself. We first present a performance analysis ofdifferent JIT compilation technologies in order to identify hardware andsoftware optimization opportunities. Second, we propose a solution basedon a dedicated processor with specialized instructions for criticalfunctions of JIT compilers. These specialized instructions provide anaverage 5x speedup on manipulations of associative arrays and dynamicmemory allocation. Based on the LLVM framework, we show a 15\\% overallspeedup on code generator's execution time. Because our specializedinstructions are hidden behind standard libraries, we also argue thatthese instructions may be transparently reused for a wider range ofapplications.

In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules. This yields an effective and cost-efficient approach tocompositional synchronous modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployedRemora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligibleCPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. wireless sensor networks; high-level programming; component model;event-driven</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

Although there havebeen pioneering efforts in applying componentization tosystems-building, these efforts have tended to target specificapplication domains (e. g., embedded systems, operating systems,communications systems, programmable networking environments, ormiddleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantageof this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity andabstraction potential of the component approach.

The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions ofbottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verificationcomplexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verificationreuse.

While a number of widely used componentarchitectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprisecomputing rather than embedded systems. Due to the uniquecharacteristics of embedded systems, a component architecture forembedded systems must have low overhead, be able to address relevantnon-functional issues, and be flexible to accommodate applicationspecific requirements. In this paper we introduce a componentarchitecture aimed at the development of microkernel-based embeddedsystems. The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible. We have implemented a prototype of this architecture andconfirm that it has very low overhead and is suitable for implementingboth system-level and application level services.

The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component. Themethodology verifies the correctness of the glue logic inserted betweenthe components and the interaction of the components through the gluelogic. Each such glue logic is verified one at a time using modelchecking techniques.Experimental results have shown the efficiency of the proposedmethodology and demonstrated that it is feasible to apply such averification methodology on real-life examples. formal verification; petri-nets; components; iP; model checking;embedded systems; real-time systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>Embedded systems</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints. We use amulti-objective concept to model the composition analysis problem anduse an evolutionary algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal solutionsefficiently. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem. We bring forth anumber of issues related to the automation of reusable IP compositionincluding type- compatibility checking, split-programming, andintrospective composition environment, and demonstrate their utilitythrough design examples. hardware/software co-design; system-on-chip; embedded systems; hardwaredescription language (HDL); modeling; simulation; design reuse;interface design                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

This paper argues thatmodeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyzeinteractions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a morestructured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity,to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semanticframework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses theissues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desirefor component reuse.

However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication. We present an algorithm that transforms component-baseddesign spaces, expressible in CoDeL, to an SMT program, which, solved bystate-of-the-art SMT solvers, determines the satisfiability of thesynthesis problem, and delivers a correct-by-construction systemconfiguration. Evaluation results for use cases in the domain ofscheduling and mapping of distributed real-time processes confirm,first, the performance gain of SMT compared to traditional design spaceexploration approaches, second, the usability gains by expressing designproblems in CoDeL, and third, the capability of the CoDeL/SMT approachto support the design of embedded systems.

As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess.

While technologyexists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-basedapplications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools.Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very fewexisting and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution todevelopers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integratedmodel-driven development environment that addresses all phases ofapplication lifecycle including design, development, verification,analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, withsupporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such amodel-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, thispaper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMSML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specificsub-languages. We claim that the language promotes``correct-by-construction\\{''\\} software development and integration bysupporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle.

Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in \\{{[}\\}1{]}). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself. We first present a performance analysis ofdifferent JIT compilation technologies in order to identify hardware andsoftware optimization opportunities. Second, we propose a solution basedon a dedicated processor with specialized instructions for criticalfunctions of JIT compilers. These specialized instructions provide anaverage 5x speedup on manipulations of associative arrays and dynamicmemory allocation. Based on the LLVM framework, we show a 15\\textbackslash{}\\% overallspeedup on code generator's execution time. Because our specializedinstructions are hidden behind standard libraries, we also argue thatthese instructions may be transparently reused for a wider range ofapplications.

In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules. This yields an effective and cost-efficient approach tocompositional synchronous modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system.

To alleviate the burden on students in the roboticscurriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform onembedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has beendeveloped and fabricated as a supplement for these students. Thisgeneral-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial trainingkits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has beenbrought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and C/OS-II suchthat it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition tolinking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, userscan program the codes not only in C language, but also through visualprogramming by means of a graphic interface developed along with theplatform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot functiondesign. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping inrobotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated withthe platform has been designed and used in classes. Based on assessmentsand evaluation on the students who have completed this course, thecurricular training is satisfactory and largely meets the requirementsestablished at the design stage.

They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers).

The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down.

While a number of widely used componentarchitectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprisecomputing rather than embedded systems.

The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible.

The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component. Themethodology verifies the correctness of the glue logic inserted betweenthe components and the interaction of the components through the gluelogic.

To this end, this paper applies modelchecking techniques to DRE design models using model transformations toverify key QoS properties of component-based DRE systems developed usingReal-time CORBA. We introduce a formal semantic domain for a generalclass of DRE systems that enables the verification of distributednon-preemptive real-time scheduling. Our results show that model-basedtechniques enable design-time analysis of timed properties and can beapplied to effectively predict, simulate, and verify the event-drivenbehavior of component-based DRE systems. schedulability analysis; model checking; component middleware;distributed real-time; embedded systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints. We use amulti-objective concept to model the composition analysis problem anduse an evolutionary algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal solutionsefficiently. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem. We bring forth anumber of issues related to the automation of reusable IP compositionincluding type- compatibility checking, split-programming, andintrospective composition environment, and demonstrate their utilitythrough design examples. hardware/software co-design; system-on-chip; embedded systems; hardwaredescription language (HDL); modeling; simulation; design reuse;interface design                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

This paper argues thatmodeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyzeinteractions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a morestructured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity,to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semanticframework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses theissues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desirefor component reuse.

However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication. We present an algorithm that transforms component-baseddesign spaces, expressible in CoDeL, to an SMT program, which, solved bystate-of-the-art SMT solvers, determines the satisfiability of thesynthesis problem, and delivers a correct-by-construction systemconfiguration. Evaluation results for use cases in the domain ofscheduling and mapping of distributed real-time processes confirm,first, the performance gain of SMT compared to traditional design spaceexploration approaches, second, the usability gains by expressing designproblems in CoDeL, and third, the capability of the CoDeL/SMT approachto support the design of embedded systems.

       "| Automatic synthesis of communication and concurrency for exploringcomponent-based system implementations considering UML channel semantics | 10.1016/j.sysarc.2015.07.002 | 2015 | Automatic synthesis of communication and concurrency for exploringcomponent-based system implementations considering UML channel semantics Nowadays, multi-processor systems play a critical role in embeddedsystem engineering. As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess. To demonstrate these capabilities, the methodology is testedwith two large examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is a need for an integratedmodel-driven development environment that addresses all phases ofapplication lifecycle including design, development, verification,analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, withsupporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such amodel-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, thispaper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMSML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specificsub-languages.

Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in {[}1]). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself. We first present a performance analysis ofdifferent JIT compilation technologies in order to identify hardware andsoftware optimization opportunities. Second, we propose a solution basedon a dedicated processor with specialized instructions for criticalfunctions of JIT compilers. These specialized instructions provide anaverage 5x speedup on manipulations of associative arrays and dynamicmemory allocation. Based on the LLVM framework, we show a 15\\% overallspeedup on code generator's execution time. Because our specializedinstructions are hidden behind standard libraries, we also argue thatthese instructions may be transparently reused for a wider range ofapplications.

In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision.

However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployedRemora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligibleCPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. wireless sensor networks; high-level programming; component model;event-driven | embedded systems | embedded systems | embedded system |\n",

To alleviate the burden on students in the roboticscurriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform onembedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has beendeveloped and fabricated as a supplement for these students. Thisgeneral-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial trainingkits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has beenbrought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and C/OS-II suchthat it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition tolinking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, userscan program the codes not only in C language, but also through visualprogramming by means of a graphic interface developed along with theplatform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot functiondesign. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping inrobotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated withthe platform has been designed and used in classes. Based on assessmentsand evaluation on the students who have completed this course, thecurricular training is satisfactory and largely meets the requirementsestablished at the design stage.

They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers).

The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down.

The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible.

The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component. Themethodology verifies the correctness of the glue logic inserted betweenthe components and the interaction of the components through the gluelogic.

However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints. We use amulti-objective concept to model the composition analysis problem anduse an evolutionary algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal solutionsefficiently. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem. We bring forth anumber of issues related to the automation of reusable IP compositionincluding type- compatibility checking, split-programming, andintrospective composition environment, and demonstrate their utilitythrough design examples. hardware/software co-design; system-on-chip; embedded systems; hardwaredescription language (HDL); modeling; simulation; design reuse;interface design                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | embedded systems | embedded systems | embedded system |\n",

       "1  Component-Based Synthesis of Embedded Systems Using SatisfiabilityModulo Theories Constraint programming solvers, such as Satisfiability Modulo Theory(SMT) solvers, are capable tools in finding preferable configurationsfor embedded systems from large design spaces. However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication. We present an algorithm that transforms component-baseddesign spaces, expressible in CoDeL, to an SMT program, which, solved bystate-of-the-art SMT solvers, determines the satisfiability of thesynthesis problem, and delivers a correct-by-construction systemconfiguration. Evaluation results for use cases in the domain ofscheduling and mapping of distributed real-time processes confirm,first, the performance gain of SMT compared to traditional design spaceexploration approaches, second, the usability gains by expressing designproblems in CoDeL, and third, the capability of the CoDeL/SMT approachto support the design of embedded systems.

       "2  Automatic synthesis of communication and concurrency for exploringcomponent-based system implementations considering UML channel semantics Nowadays, multi-processor systems play a critical role in embeddedsystem engineering. As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models.

To demonstrate these capabilities, the methodology is testedwith two large examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

       "3  DREMS ML: A wide spectrum architecture design language for distributedcomputing platforms Complex sensing, processing and control applications running ondistributed platforms are difficult to design, develop, analyze,integrate, deploy and operate, especially if resource constraints, faulttolerance and security issues are to be addressed. While technologyexists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-basedapplications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools.Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very fewexisting and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution todevelopers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integratedmodel-driven development environment that addresses all phases ofapplication lifecycle including design, development, verification,analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, withsupporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such amodel-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, thispaper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMSML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specificsub-languages. We claim that the language promotes``correct-by-construction{''} software development and integration bysupporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle. Using acase study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS ML impacts thedevelopment of embedded systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

       "4  Contracts-refinement proof system for component-based embedded systems Contract-based design is an emerging paradigm for the design of complexsystems, where each component is associated with a contract, i.e., aclear description of the expected interaction of the component with itsenvironment. Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in {[}1]). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

       "5  Hardware Acceleration of Red-Black Tree Management and Application toJust-In-Time Compilation Due to the everlasting consumer demand for more complex applications,embedded systems have evolved both in terms of complexity andheterogeneity. The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself. We first present a performance analysis ofdifferent JIT compilation technologies in order to identify hardware andsoftware optimization opportunities. Second, we propose a solution basedon a dedicated processor with specialized instructions for criticalfunctions of JIT compilers. These specialized instructions provide anaverage 5x speedup on manipulations of associative arrays and dynamicmemory allocation. Based on the LLVM framework, we show a 15\\\\% overallspeedup on code generator's execution time. Because our specializedinstructions are hidden behind standard libraries, we also argue thatthese instructions may be transparently reused for a wider range ofapplications.

       "6  MOO: An architectural framework for runtime optimization of multiplesystem objectives in embedded control software Today's complex embedded systems function in varying operationalconditions. The control software adapts several control variables tokeep the operational state optimal with respect to multiple objectives.There exist well-known techniques for solving such optimizationproblems. However, current practice shows that the applied techniques,control variables, constraints and related design decisions are notdocumented as a part of the architecture description. Theirimplementation is implicit, tailored for specific characteristics of theembedded system, tightly integrated into and coupled with the controlsoftware, which hinders its reusability, analyzability andmaintainability. This paper presents an architectural framework todesign, document and realize multi-objective optimization in embeddedcontrol software. The framework comprises an architectural styletogether with its visual editor and domain-specific analysis tools, anda code generator. The code generator generates an optimizer modulespecific for the given architecture and it employs aspect-orientedsoftware development techniques to seamlessly integrate this module intothe control software.

A case study is conducted inwhich an architecture optimization framework is applied to an existingsub-system in the automotive industry. The case study shows thatmetaheuristic optimization approaches can find efficient solutions forall quality attributes while fulfilling given constraints.By optimizing multiple quality attributes the framework proposesrevolutionary architecture solutions in contrast to human architects,who tend to propose solutions based on previous architectures. Althoughthe case study shows savings in manual effort, it also shows that theproposed architecture solutions should be assessed by the humanarchitect.

       "9  Compositional design of isochronous systems The synchronous modeling paradigm provides strong correctness guaranteesfor embedded system design while requiring minimal environmentalassumptions. In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules. This yields an effective and cost-efficient approach tocompositional synchronous modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

       "10 A Generic Component-Based Approach for Programming, Composing and TuningSensor Software Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being extensively deployed today invarious monitoring and control applications by enabling rapiddeployments at low cost and with high flexibility. However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployedRemora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligibleCPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. wireless sensor networks; high-level programming; component model;event-driven\n",
       "11 Rapid Prototyping Platform for Robotics Applications For the past several years, a team in the Department of ElectricalEngineering (EE), National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan, has beenestablishing a pedagogical approach to embody embedded systems in thecontext of robotics. To alleviate the burden on students in the roboticscurriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform onembedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has beendeveloped and fabricated as a supplement for these students. Thisgeneral-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial trainingkits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has beenbrought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and C/OS-II suchthat it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition tolinking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, userscan program the codes not only in C language, but also through visualprogramming by means of a graphic interface developed along with theplatform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot functiondesign. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping inrobotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated withthe platform has been designed and used in classes. Based on assessmentsand evaluation on the students who have completed this course, thecurricular training is satisfactory and largely meets the requirementsestablished at the design stage.

       "13 A generic component model for building systems software Component-based software structuring principles are now commonplace atthe application level; but componentization is far less established whenit comes to building low-level systems software. Although there havebeen pioneering efforts in applying componentization tosystems-building, these efforts have tended to target specificapplication domains (e. g., embedded systems, operating systems,communications systems, programmable networking environments, ormiddleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantageof this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity andabstraction potential of the component approach. In this article, weargue for the benefits and feasibility of a generic yet tailorableapproach to component-based systems-building that offers a uniformprogramming model that is applicable in a wide range of systems-orientedtarget domains and deployment environments. The component model, calledOpenCom, is supported by a reflective runtime architecture that isitself built from components. After describing OpenCom and evaluatingits performance and overhead characteristics, we present and evaluatetwo case studies of systems we have built using OpenCom technology, thusillustrating its benefits and its general applicability. design; standardization; management; component-based software; computersystems implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "14 Component-based hardware/software co-verification for buildingtrustworthy embedded systems We present a novel component-based approach to hardware/softwareco-verification of embedded systems using model checking. Embeddedsystems are pervasive and often mission-critical, therefore, they mustbe highly trustworthy. Trustworthy embedded systems require extensiveverification. The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions ofbottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verificationcomplexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verificationreuse. Case studies on a suite of networked sensors have shown that ourapproach facilitates major verification reuse and leads toorder-of-magnitude reduction on verification complexity.

       "15 CAmkES: A component model for secure microkernel-based embedded systems Component-based software engineering promises to provide structure andreusability to embedded-systems software. At the same time,microkernel-based operating systems are being used to increase thereliability and trustworthiness of embedded systems. Since themicrokernel approach to designing systems is partially based on thecomponentisation of system services, component-based softwareengineering is a particularly attractive approach to developingmicrokernel-based systems. While a number of widely used componentarchitectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprisecomputing rather than embedded systems. Due to the uniquecharacteristics of embedded systems, a component architecture forembedded systems must have low overhead, be able to address relevantnon-functional issues, and be flexible to accommodate applicationspecific requirements. In this paper we introduce a componentarchitecture aimed at the development of microkernel-based embeddedsystems. The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible. We have implemented a prototype of this architecture andconfirm that it has very low overhead and is suitable for implementingboth system-level and application level services.

       "16 Formal verification of component-based designs Embedded systems are becoming increasingly common in our everyday lives.As technology progresses, these systems become more and more complex,and designers handle this increasing complexity by reusing existingcomponents (Intellectual Property blocks). At the same time, the systemsmust fulfill strict requirements on reliability and correctness.This paper proposes a formal verification methodology which smoothlyintegrates with component-based system-level design using a divide andconquer approach. The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component. Themethodology verifies the correctness of the glue logic inserted betweenthe components and the interaction of the components through the gluelogic. Each such glue logic is verified one at a time using modelchecking techniques.Experimental results have shown the efficiency of the proposedmethodology and demonstrated that it is feasible to apply such averification methodology on real-life examples. formal verification; petri-nets; components; iP; model checking;embedded systems; real-time systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Model-based technologies help address theseissues by enabling design-time analysis, and providing the means toautomate the development, deployment, configuration, and integration ofcomponent-based DRE systems. To this end, this paper applies modelchecking techniques to DRE design models using model transformations toverify key QoS properties of component-based DRE systems developed usingReal-time CORBA. We introduce a formal semantic domain for a generalclass of DRE systems that enables the verification of distributednon-preemptive real-time scheduling.

       "19 QoS analysis for component-based embedded software: Model andmethodology Component-based development (CBD) techniques have been widely used toenhance the productivity and reduce the cost for software systemsdevelopment. However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints. We use amulti-objective concept to model the composition analysis problem anduse an evolutionary algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal solutionsefficiently. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

       "20 BALBOA: A component-based design environment for system models This paper presents the BALBOA component composition framework forsystem-level architectural design. It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem. We bring forth anumber of issues related to the automation of reusable IP compositionincluding type- compatibility checking, split-programming, andintrospective composition environment, and demonstrate their utilitythrough design examples. hardware/software co-design; system-on-chip; embedded systems; hardwaredescription language (HDL); modeling; simulation; design reuse;interface design                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "21 On efficient program synthesis from statecharts Program synthesis from hierarchical state diagrams has for long beendiscussed in various communities. My aim is to provide an efficient,lightweight code generation scheme suitable for resource constrainedmicrocontrollers.I describe an initial implementation of SCOPE-a hierarchical codegenerator for a variant of the statechart language. I shall discussseveral techniques implemented in the tool, namely imposing andexploiting a regular hierarchy structure, labeling schemes for fastancestor queries, improvements in exiting states, compile-time scoperesolution for transitions, and various details of compact runtimerepresentation.The resulting algorithm avoids the exponential code growth exhibited bytools based on flattening of hierarchical state machine. At the sametime it demonstrates that it is possible to maintain reasonable speedand size results even for small models, while preserving the hierarchyat runtime. SCOPE currently produces code that is comparable with thatof industrial tools (IAR visualSTATE) for small models and clearly winsfor bigger ones. algorithms; performance; program synthesis; automatic code generation;statecharts; embedded systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "22 Taming heterogeneity the Ptolemy approach Modern embedded computing systems tend to be heterogeneous in the senseof being composed of subsystems with very different characteristics,which communicate and interact in a variety of ways-synchronous orasynchronous, buffered or unbuffered, etc. Obviously, when designingsuch systems, a modeling language needs to reflect this heterogeneity.Today's modeling environments usually offer a variant of what we callamorphous heterogeneity to address this problem. This paper argues thatmodeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyzeinteractions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a morestructured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity,to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semanticframework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses theissues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desirefor component reuse. It introduces the notion of domain polymorphism asa way to address these issues. component-based design; embedded systems; heterogeneous modeling; modelsof computation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

The viewpoint of the use case modelthat views a system as a black box focuses on descriptions of externalinteractions between the system and related environments. However, forembedded systems that do not disclose most implementation logics outsidethe system, black box-based use case models may experience the drawbackthat considerable information that must be defined for systemdevelopments is omitted. To solve this shortcoming, several studies havebeen proposed on the use of kind of white box technique in which thedynamic behaviors of embedded systems are defined first using a statediagram and the results are reflected in the requirement specifications.However, white box-based modeling has not been widely adopted bydevelopers due to tasks that require a lot of time in the requirementanalysis phase in the initial phase of the software development lifecycle. This study proposes a gray box-based requirement specificationmethod as a trade-off between two contradictory elements (the amount ofinformation required to develop an embedded system and the cost of theeffort required during the requirement analysis phase) in terms of thetwo approaches, the black and the white box-based models. The proposedmethod suggests that an appropriate depth level of embedded systemmodeling is required to define the requirements. This study alsoproposes a mechanism that automatically generates an applicationprogramming interface for each component based on the created model.

In this way it ispossible to investigate the effects of power converter faults inelectrical drives with the aim to propose solutions that allow to reducethe periods of drives inoperability. In this paper, a suitablerealization of a test bench combining an embedded system based on a FPGAboard with a high-level graphical programming language is proposed toreplace part of the electrical drive hardware. Differently than standardapproaches for FPGA programming, which are normally based on hardwaredescription languages, the proposed solution exploits an environmentsoftware platform with a high level of abstraction that leads to a goodtrade-off between accuracy and hardware resources, also allowing afaster prototyping procedure. The proposed HIL solution has been used tostudy some common faults occurring in power converters, evaluating thebehavior of a standard drive operating with different controlalgorithms.

The typical specialization process is based on a mixof precompiler macros and build scripts, both of which are known forbeing sources of errors.In this article, we present a new model-based approach to the design ofapplication-specific RTOS. Starting with finite state models describingthe RTOS and the application requirements, the set of blocks in the RTOScode actually used by the application is automatically computed. Thisset is used to build an application-specific RTOS model. This model isfed into a code generator to produce the source code of anapplication-specific RTOS. It is also used to carry on model-basedvalidations and verifications, including the formal verification thatthe specialization process did not introduce unwanted behaviors orsuppress expected ones.To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, it is applied tospecialize Trampoline, an open-source implementation of the AUTOSAR OSstandard, to an industrial case study from the automotive domain.

However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication. We present an algorithm that transforms component-baseddesign spaces, expressible in CoDeL, to an SMT program, which, solved bystate-of-the-art SMT solvers, determines the satisfiability of thesynthesis problem, and delivers a correct-by-construction systemconfiguration. Evaluation results for use cases in the domain ofscheduling and mapping of distributed real-time processes confirm,first, the performance gain of SMT compared to traditional design spaceexploration approaches, second, the usability gains by expressing designproblems in CoDeL, and third, the capability of the CoDeL/SMT approachto support the design of embedded systems.

As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess. To demonstrate these capabilities, the methodology is testedwith two large examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While technologyexists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-basedapplications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools.Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very fewexisting and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution todevelopers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integratedmodel-driven development environment that addresses all phases ofapplication lifecycle including design, development, verification,analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, withsupporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such amodel-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, thispaper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMSML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specificsub-languages.

Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in {[}1]). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself. We first present a performance analysis ofdifferent JIT compilation technologies in order to identify hardware andsoftware optimization opportunities. Second, we propose a solution basedon a dedicated processor with specialized instructions for criticalfunctions of JIT compilers. These specialized instructions provide anaverage 5x speedup on manipulations of associative arrays and dynamicmemory allocation. Based on the LLVM framework, we show a 15\\% overallspeedup on code generator's execution time. Because our specializedinstructions are hidden behind standard libraries, we also argue thatthese instructions may be transparently reused for a wider range ofapplications.

These components need to interact in atimely fashion to achieve the system level end-to-end requirements. Inpractice, the component level timing specification consists of designattributes like component task mapping, task period and scheduledefinition but often lack details on their real-time (functional)requirements. As we observe, there is no systematic methodology in placefor decomposing the feature level timing requirements into componentlevel timing requirements. This paper proposes an early stagetime-budgeting methodology to bridge the above gap. A salient proposalof this methodology is to consider parameterized componenttiming-requirements. A key step in the methodology involves computing aset of constraints by relating component requirements with featurerequirements. This enables the separation of timing constraints fromfunctionality decomposition, and facilitates early optimization of thecomponent time-budget for a complex component based embedded system.This paper formalizes the proposed methodology by using ParametricTemporal Logic. A case study involving two advanced features from theautomotive domain, namely Adaptive Cruise Control and CollisionMitigation is given to demonstrate the methodology.

The control software adapts several control variables tokeep the operational state optimal with respect to multiple objectives.There exist well-known techniques for solving such optimizationproblems. However, current practice shows that the applied techniques,control variables, constraints and related design decisions are notdocumented as a part of the architecture description. Theirimplementation is implicit, tailored for specific characteristics of theembedded system, tightly integrated into and coupled with the controlsoftware, which hinders its reusability, analyzability andmaintainability.

To design a system whichmeets all its quality requirements becomes increasingly difficultbecause of customer demand for new innovative user functions. Methodsand tools are needed to assist the architect during system design.The goal of this paper is to show how metaheuristic optimizationapproaches can improve the process of designing efficient architecturesfor a set of given quality attributes. A case study is conducted inwhich an architecture optimization framework is applied to an existingsub-system in the automotive industry. The case study shows thatmetaheuristic optimization approaches can find efficient solutions forall quality attributes while fulfilling given constraints.By optimizing multiple quality attributes the framework proposesrevolutionary architecture solutions in contrast to human architects,who tend to propose solutions based on previous architectures. Althoughthe case study shows savings in manual effort, it also shows that theproposed architecture solutions should be assessed by the humanarchitect. So, the paper demonstrates how an architecture optimizationframework complements the domain knowledge and experience of thearchitect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Such a system isdataflow (for its description) and time triggered (for its execution).The architecture forms a graph of communicating components, where morethan one path can link two components. Because the characteristics ofthe network and the behavior of intermediate components may vary or areonly partially known, these paths often have different timingcharacteristics, and the flows of information that transit on thesepaths reach their destination at independent times. However, anapplication that seeks consistent values will require these flows to betemporally matched so that a component uses inputs that all (directly orindirectly) depend on the same computation step of another component. Inthis paper, we define this temporal data-matching property, both in astrict sense and in a relaxed way allowing approximately consistentvalues. Then, we show how to analyze a system architecture to detectsituations that result in data-matching inconsistencies. In the contextof multiperiodic systems, where components do not necessarily share acommon period, we also describe an approach to manage data matching thatuses queues to delay too fast paths and timestamps to recognizeconsistent data sets.

These new features needto be considered as early as possible in the software development lifecycle. Model driven engineering promotes an intensive use of models andis now widely seen as a solution to master the development of complexsystems such as embedded ones. Component-based software engineering isanother major trend that gains acceptance in the embedded world becauseof its properties such as reuse, modularity, and flexibility. Thisarticle proposes the Flex-eWare component model (FCM) for designing andimplementing modern embedded systems. The FCM unifies model drivenengineering and component-based software engineering and has beenevaluated in several application domains with different requirements:wireless sensor networks, distributed client/server applications, andcontrol systems for electrical devices. This approach highlights a newconcept: flexibility points that arise at several stages of thedevelopment process, that is, in the model (design phase), in theexecution platform, and during the execution itself. This flexibilitypoints are captured with model libraries that can extend the FCM.Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \\&amp; Sons, Ltd. embedded system; software component; flexibility; model drivenengineering                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </span></td><td>embedded system </td><td>embedded system </td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

Asthey integrate hard- and software elements, their functionality andreliability are often tested by hardware-in-the-loop methods, in whichthe system under test runs in a simulated environment. Due to the risingcomplexity of the embedded functions, performance limitations andpracticability reasons, the simulations are often specialized to testspecific aspects of the embedded system and develop a high diversity bythemselves. This diversity is difficult to manage for a user and resultsin erroneously selected test components and compatibility problems inthe test configuration. This paper presents a generative programmingapproach that handles the diversity of test libraries. Compatibilityissues are explicitly evaluated by a new interface concept. Furthermore,a novel model analyzer facilitates the efficient application in practiceby migrating existing libraries.

In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules. This yields an effective and cost-efficient approach tocompositional synchronous modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployedRemora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligibleCPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. wireless sensor networks; high-level programming; component model;event-driven                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

To alleviate the burden on students in the roboticscurriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform onembedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has beendeveloped and fabricated as a supplement for these students. Thisgeneral-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial trainingkits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has beenbrought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and C/OS-II suchthat it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition tolinking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, userscan program the codes not only in C language, but also through visualprogramming by means of a graphic interface developed along with theplatform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot functiondesign.

Nowadays, limited relatedworks have been proposed to address particular cases of reconfigurationswithout considering distributed architectures. Our first problem is tobe able to handle all possible forms of reconfigurations that can beapplied at run-time to distributed Function Blocks. In this case, acoordination between devices of the execution environment should beapplied to guarantee safe and coherent distributed reconfigurations. Asecond problem is to find the sufficient solutions for the correctimplementation of this reconfigurable distributed architecture.Objective: The paper defines an implementable multi-agent architecturefor automatic and coherent reconfigurations of distributed FunctionBlocks.Method: To address all possible industrial forms, we classify thereconfiguration scenarios into three levels. The first level deals withadditions-removals of Function Blocks to-from the system'simplementation. The second deals with updates of compositions of blocks,and the third deals with updates of data. We define a ReconfigurationAgent for each device of the execution environment, and a uniqueCoordination Agent for coordinations between devices. EachReconfiguration Agent to be modelled by nested state machines applieslocal reconfiguration scenarios in the corresponding device aftercoordinations with the Coordination Agent. We propose an Inter-AgentsCommunication Protocol to support correct and coherent reconfigurationsof distributed devices. This protocol is based on Coordination Matricesto be handled by the Coordination Agent in order to define allreconfiguration scenarios that should be simultaneously applied indistributed devices. We propose XML-based implementations for both kindsof agents where XML code blocks are exchanged between devices toguarantee safety distributed reconfigurations. The contributions of thepaper are applied to two Benchmark Production Systems available in ourresearch laboratory.Results: The communication protocol is successfully applied to ourplatforms where simulations are executed to check distributed andcoherent reconfiguration scenarios. The Reconfiguration and CoordinationAgents are implemented in this platform by following the InternationalStandard IEC61499. We show in addition XML-based successful interactionsbetween devices when distributed reconfigurations are applied.Conclusion: The paper successfully defines a multi-agent architecturefor IEC61499 distributed reconfigurable embedded systems whereCoordination and Reconfiguration agents are proposed to allow feasibleand coherent distributed reconfigurations by using a definedcommunication protocol. This architecture is implemented in XML andapplied to real industrial platforms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Although there havebeen pioneering efforts in applying componentization tosystems-building, these efforts have tended to target specificapplication domains (e. g., embedded systems, operating systems,communications systems, programmable networking environments, ormiddleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantageof this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity andabstraction potential of the component approach. In this article, weargue for the benefits and feasibility of a generic yet tailorableapproach to component-based systems-building that offers a uniformprogramming model that is applicable in a wide range of systems-orientedtarget domains and deployment environments. The component model, calledOpenCom, is supported by a reflective runtime architecture that isitself built from components.

Embeddedsystems are pervasive and often mission-critical, therefore, they mustbe highly trustworthy. Trustworthy embedded systems require extensiveverification. The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions ofbottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verificationcomplexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verificationreuse.

At the same time,microkernel-based operating systems are being used to increase thereliability and trustworthiness of embedded systems. Since themicrokernel approach to designing systems is partially based on thecomponentisation of system services, component-based softwareengineering is a particularly attractive approach to developingmicrokernel-based systems. While a number of widely used componentarchitectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprisecomputing rather than embedded systems. Due to the uniquecharacteristics of embedded systems, a component architecture forembedded systems must have low overhead, be able to address relevantnon-functional issues, and be flexible to accommodate applicationspecific requirements. In this paper we introduce a componentarchitecture aimed at the development of microkernel-based embeddedsystems. The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible. We have implemented a prototype of this architecture andconfirm that it has very low overhead and is suitable for implementingboth system-level and application level services.

At the same time, the systemsmust fulfill strict requirements on reliability and correctness.This paper proposes a formal verification methodology which smoothlyintegrates with component-based system-level design using a divide andconquer approach. The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component. Themethodology verifies the correctness of the glue logic inserted betweenthe components and the interaction of the components through the gluelogic. Each such glue logic is verified one at a time using modelchecking techniques.Experimental results have shown the efficiency of the proposedmethodology and demonstrated that it is feasible to apply such averification methodology on real-life examples. formal verification; petri-nets; components; iP; model checking;embedded systems; real-time systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td><td>Embedded systems</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

Developers want to maximizethe use of the limited resources available on the device while still notexceeding the capabilities of the device. To do this, the developer mustbe able to scale his software for different platforms. In this paper, wepresent a software engineering methodology that automatically scalessoftware to different platforms. We intend to have the applicationdeveloper write high level functional specifications of his software andhave tools that automatically scale the underlying runtime. These toolswill use the functional and non-functional constraints of both thehardware and client application to produce an appropriate runtime. Ourinitial results show that the proposed approach can scale operatingsystems and virtual machines that satisfy the constraints of varyinghardware/application combinations. design; performance; languages; embedded systems; runtime systems;components; constraints; wireless sensor networks; generativeprogramming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

Component middleware,however, also introduces challenges for DRE system developers, such asevaluating the predictability of DRE system behavior, and choosing theright design alternatives before committing to a specific platform orplatform configuration. Model-based technologies help address theseissues by enabling design-time analysis, and providing the means toautomate the development, deployment, configuration, and integration ofcomponent-based DRE systems. To this end, this paper applies modelchecking techniques to DRE design models using model transformations toverify key QoS properties of component-based DRE systems developed usingReal-time CORBA. We introduce a formal semantic domain for a generalclass of DRE systems that enables the verification of distributednon-preemptive real-time scheduling.

However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints. We use amulti-objective concept to model the composition analysis problem anduse an evolutionary algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal solutionsefficiently. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem. We bring forth anumber of issues related to the automation of reusable IP compositionincluding type- compatibility checking, split-programming, andintrospective composition environment, and demonstrate their utilitythrough design examples. hardware/software co-design; system-on-chip; embedded systems; hardwaredescription language (HDL); modeling; simulation; design reuse;interface design                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

My aim is to provide an efficient,lightweight code generation scheme suitable for resource constrainedmicrocontrollers.I describe an initial implementation of SCOPE-a hierarchical codegenerator for a variant of the statechart language. I shall discussseveral techniques implemented in the tool, namely imposing andexploiting a regular hierarchy structure, labeling schemes for fastancestor queries, improvements in exiting states, compile-time scoperesolution for transitions, and various details of compact runtimerepresentation.The resulting algorithm avoids the exponential code growth exhibited bytools based on flattening of hierarchical state machine. At the sametime it demonstrates that it is possible to maintain reasonable speedand size results even for small models, while preserving the hierarchyat runtime. SCOPE currently produces code that is comparable with thatof industrial tools (IAR visualSTATE) for small models and clearly winsfor bigger ones. algorithms; performance; program synthesis; automatic code generation;statecharts; embedded systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

This paper argues thatmodeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyzeinteractions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a morestructured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity,to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semanticframework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses theissues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desirefor component reuse. It introduces the notion of domain polymorphism asa way to address these issues. component-based design; embedded systems; heterogeneous modeling; modelsof computation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded systems</td><td>embedded system</td></tr>\n",

To obtain a low-cost and portablesolution for implementing the DTCWT in multi-channel real-timeapplications, various embedded-system approaches are realised. Forcomparison, the DTCWT was implemented in C language on a personalcomputer and on a PIC microcontroller. However, in the former approachportability and in the latter desired speed performance propertiescannot be achieved. Hence, implementation of the DTCWT on areconfigurable platform such as field programmable gate array, whichprovides portable, low-cost, low-power, and high-performance computing,is considered as the most feasible solution. At first, they used thesystem generator DSP design tool of Xilinx for algorithm design.However, the design implemented by using such tools is not optimised interms of area and power. To overcome all these drawbacks mentionedabove, they implemented the DTCWT algorithm by using Verilog HardwareDescription Language, which has its own difficulties. To overcome thesedifficulties, simplify the usage of proposed algorithms and theadaptation procedures, a code generator program that can producedifferent architectures is proposed.

In this way, properties that can only beroughly estimated statically are evaluated against observed values andthis consequently allows to refine the design models for ensuringpreservation of analysed extra-functional properties at code level.Method: Following the model-driven engineering vision, (meta-) modelsand transformations are used as main artefacts for the realisation ofthe round-trip support which is finally validated against an industrialcase study.Result: This article presents an approach to support the wholeround-trip process starting from the generation of source code for atarget platform, passing through the monitoring of selected systemquality attributes at code level, and finishing with theback-propagation of observed values to modelling level. The technique isvalidated against an industrial case study in the telecommunicationsapplicative domain.Conclusion: Preservation of extra-functional properties throughappropriate description, computation and evaluation makes it possible toreduce final product verification and validation effort and costs bygenerating correct-by-construction code. The proposed round-trip supportaids a model-driven component-based development process in ensuring adesired level of extra-functional properties preservation from thesource modelling artefacts to the generated code.

The current implementation targets problem families that can betransformed, using disciplined convex programming techniques, to convexquadratic programs of modest size. CVXGEN generates simple, flat,library-free code suitable for embedding in real-time applications. Thegenerated code is almost branch free, and so has highly predictablerun-time behavior. The combination of regularization (both static anddynamic) and iterative refinement in the search direction computationyields reliable performance, even with poor quality data.

SR models allowto formally verify the correctness of the design and automaticallygenerate the implementation code. This feature is a major productivityenhancement and, more importantly, can ensure correct-by-design softwareprovided that the code generator is provably correct. This paperpresents an improvement of code generation technology for SR obtainedvia a novel algorithm for optimizing the multitask implementation ofSimulink models on single-processor platforms with limited availabilityof memory. Existing code generation tools require the addition ofzero-order hold (ZOH) blocks, and therefore additional memory, andpossibly also additional functional delays whenever there is a ratetransition in the computation and communication flow.

However, as the complexity of embedded systemsincreases, software programming on an increasing number ofmultiprocessors faces several critical problems, such as multithreadedcode generation, heterogeneous architecture adaptation, short designtime, and low cost implementation. In this paper, we present a softwarecode generation flow based on Simulink to address these problems. Wepropose a functional modeling style to capture data-intensive andcontrol-dependent target applications, and a system architecturemodeling style to seamlessly transform the functional model into thetarget architecture. Both models are described using Simulink. From asystem architecture Simulink model, a code generator produces amultithreaded code, inserting thread and communication primitives toabstract the heterogeneity of the target architecture. In addition, themultithread code generator called LESCEA applies the extensions ofdataflow based memory optimization techniques, considering both data andcontrol dependency. Experimental results on a Motion-JPEG decoder and anH.264 decoder show that the proposed multithread code generator enableseasy software programming on different multiprocessor architectures withsubstantially reduced data memory size (up to 68.0\\%) and code memorysize (up to 15.9\\%). multithreaded code generation; memory size reduction; multiprocessorSoC; Simulink                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>code generator </td><td>code generator </td><td>code gener</td></tr>\n",

Wedescribe an implemented technique for producing optimizing compilers forDSELs, based on Kamin's idea of DSELs for program generation. Thetechnique uses a data type of syntax for basic types, a set of smartconstructors that perform rewriting over those types, some code motiontransformations, and a back-end code generator. Domain-specificoptimization results from chains of domain-independent rewrites on basictypes. New DSELs are defined directly in terms of the basic syntactictypes, plus host language functions and tuples. This definition stylemakes compilers easy to write and, in fact, almost identical to thesimplest embedded interpreters.

The challenges for tomorrow'sautomation systems need software architectures of today's real-timecontrollers to evolve.This article presents FASA, a modern software architecture fornext-generation automation systems. FASA provides concepts for scalable,flexible, and platform-independent real-time execution frameworks, whichalso provide advanced features such as software-based fault toleranceand high degrees of isolation and security. We show that FASA caters forrobust execution of time-critical applications even in parallelexecution environments such as multi-core processors.We present a reference implementation of FASA that controls a magneticlevitation device. This device is sensitive to any disturbance in itsreal-time control and thus, provides a suitable validation scenario. Ourresults show that FASA can sustain its advanced features even inhigh-speed control scenarios at 1 kHz. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Unfortunately however, thereported level of adoption has been comparatively low. Where successeswere had, they were largely facilitated by the manifest endorsement,where not the mandate, by relevant stakeholders, either internal to theindustrial adopter or with authority over the application domain. Thework presented in this paper stems from a comprehensive initiative takenby the European Space Agency (ESA) and its industrial suppliers. Thisinitiative also enjoyed significant synergy with interests shown forsimilar goals by the telecommunications and railways domain, thanks tothe interaction between two parallel project frameworks. The ESA effortaimed at favouring the adoption of a software reference architectureacross its software supply chain. The center of that strategy revolvesaround a component model and the software development process thatbuilds on it.

Some new mechanisms have beenintroduced in the underlying framework that make it possible to schedulethe execution of code and the transmission of messages of an applicationwhile guaranteeing that the application will meet its timingrequirements when executed. The added mechanisms also enable theapplication designer to configure this scheduling without interferingwith the opacity typically required in component management. Moreover,the methodology includes a process for generating the real-time model ofa component-based application as a composition of the reusable real-timemodels of the components that form it. From the analysis of this modelthe application designer obtains the configuration values that must beapplied to the component instances and the elements of the framework inorder to make the application fulfil its timing requirements.

They are ubiquitous intoday's technological landscape and found in domains such astelecommunications, nuclear power, avionics, and medical technology.These systems are difficult to design and build because they mustsatisfy both functional and timing requirements to work correctly intheir intended environment. Furthermore, embedded systems are oftencritical systems, where failure can lead to loss of life, loss ofmission, or serious financial consequences. Because of the difficulty increating these systems and the consequences of failure, they requirerigorous and reliable design approaches. The synchronous approach is onepossible answer to this demand. Its mathematical basis provides formalconcepts that favor the trusted design of embedded real-time systems.The multiclock or polychronous model stands out from other synchronousspecification models by its capability to enable the design of systemswhere each component holds its own activation clock as well assingle-clocked systems in a uniform way. A great advantage is itsconvenience for component-based design approaches that enable modulardevelopment of increasingly complex modern systems. The expressivenessof its underlying semantics allows dealing with several issues ofreal-time design.

TURTLE relies on UML's extensibility mechanisms to enhanceclass and activity diagrams. Class diagrams are extended withspecialized classes named Tclasses, which communicate and synchronizethrough gates. Also, associations between Tclasses are attributed by acomposition operator (Parallel, Synchro, Invocation, Sequence, orPreemption) which provides them with a formal semantics. TURTLE extendsUML activity diagrams with synchronization actions and temporaloperators ( deterministic delay, nondeterministic delay, time-limitedoffer, and time-capture). The real-time dimension of TURTLE has beenfurther improved by the addition of two composition operators, Periodicand Suspend, as well as suspendable delay, latency, and time-limitedoffer operators at the activity diagram level. Core characteristics ofTURLE are supported by TTool-the TURTLE toolkit-which includes a diagrameditor, a RT-LOTOS code generator and a result analyzer. The toolkitreuses RTL, a RT-LOTOS validation tool offering debug-orientedsimulation and exhaustive analysis. TTool hides RT-LOTOS to the end-userand allows him/her to directly check TURTLE modeling against logicalerrors and timing inconsistencies. Besides the foundations of the TURTLEprofile, this paper also discusses its application in the context ofspace-based embedded software. real-time systems; UML; RT-LOTOS; formal validation                                                                                                                                            </td><td>real-time systems</td><td>real-time systems</td><td>real-time system</td></tr>\n",

Manyrange-based localization algorithms have been proposed for 2-D sensornetworks or densely deployed 3-D sensor networks. However, range-basedlocalization in sparse 3-D sensor networks is still a challengingproblem, because the sparseness of the network makes it difficult toobtain a proper order of nodes to be sequentially localized. Thepatch-and-stitching localization strategy can conquer the sparsenessproblem in 2-D networks, but for 3-D networks it is still unknown how touniquely merge two patches when there are not enough common nodes. Inthis paper, we solve this challenging problem by deriving the conditionsunder which two subnetworks can be uniquely merged. In the proposedapproach, we treat the translation parameters as unknowns and form a setof equations with which the unknowns can be uniquely solved. The noveltyof our algorithm also lies in that we exploit both common nodes andconnecting edges among adjacent subnetworks to merge them, resulting invery high chances that two subnetworks can be merged. We conductextensive simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of theproposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm couldlocalize more than 90\\% of nodes in sparse 3-D networks with averagenode degree of 11 and anchor ratio of 5\\%, while the best existingsolution can localize only 52\\% of nodes in the same situation.

PROVIZ is an integrated visualization and programming frameworkwith the following features: PROVIZ includes (1) a visualization toolthat can visualize heterogeneous WSN traffic (with different packetpayload formats) by parsing the data received either from a packetsniffer (e.g., a sensor-based sniffer or a commercial TI SmartRF802.15.4 packet sniffer) or from a simulator (e.g., OMNeT); (2) ascripting language based on the TinyOS sensor network platform that aimsat reducing code size and improving programming efficacy; (3) anover-the-air programming tool to securely program sensor nodes; (4) avisual programming tool with basic sensor drag-and-drop modules forgenerating simple WSN programs; and (5) a visual network comparison toolthat analyzes packet traces of two networks to generate a juxtaposedvisual comparison of contrasting network characteristics. PROVIZ alsoincludes built-in extensible visual demo deployment capabilities thatallow users to quickly craft network scenarios and share them with otherusers. In this work, we introduce the various features of PROVIZ'svisualization and programming framework, analyze test scenarios, anddiscuss how all the tools can be used in sync with each other to createan all-encompassing development and test environment.

In recent years,range-free localization algorithms have drawn much research attentiondue to their low cost and applicability to large-scale WSNs. However,the application of range-free localization algorithms is restrictedbecause of their dramatic accuracy degradation in practical anisotropicWSNs, which is mainly caused by large error of distance estimation.Distance estimation in the existing range-free algorithms usually relieson a unified per hop length (PHL) metric between nodes. But the PHLbetween different nodes might be greatly different in anisotropic WSNs,resulting in large error in distance estimation. We find that, althoughthe PHL between different nodes might be greatly different, it exhibitssignificant locality; that is, nearby nodes share a similar PHL toanchors that know their positions in advance. Based on the locality ofthe PHL, a novel distance estimation approach is proposed in thisarticle. Theoretical analyses show that the error of distance estimationin the proposed approach is only one-fourth of that in thestate-of-the-art pattern-driven scheme (PDS). An anchor selectionalgorithm is also devised to further improve localization accuracy bymitigating the negative effects from the anchors that are poorlydistributed in geometry. By combining the locality-based distanceestimation and the anchor selection, a range-free localization algorithmnamed Selective Multilateration (SM) is proposed. Simulation resultsdemonstrate that SM achieves localization accuracy higher than 0.3r,where r is the communication radius of nodes. Compared to thestate-of-the-art solution, SM improves the distance estimation accuracyby up to 57\\% and improves localization accuracy by up to 52\\%consequently.

Although manylocalization algorithms have been proposed in recent years, they usuallytarget at dense networks and perform poorly in sparse networks. In thispaper, we propose two component-based localization algorithms that canlocalize many more nodes in sparse networks than the state-of-the-artsolution. We first develop the Basic Common nodes-based LocalizationAlgorithm, namely BCLA, which uses both common nodes and measureddistances between adjacent components to merge components. BCLAoutperforms CALL, the state-of-the-art component-based localizationalgorithm that uses only distance measurements to merge components. Inorder to further improve the performance of BCLA, we further exploit theangular information among nodes to merge components, and propose theComponent-based Localization with Angle and Distance informationalgorithm, namely CLAD. We prove the merging conditions for BCLA andCLAD, and evaluate their performance through extensive simulations.Simulations results show that, CLAD can locate more than 90 percent ofnodes in a sparse network with average node degree 7.5, while CALL canlocate only 78 percent of nodes in the same scenario.

However, the dynamic profiling must be able toaccurately capture application behavior without incurring significantruntime overheads. Since application-and sensor-specific constraintsdictate the profiling requirements and tolerated overheads, designersrequire design assistance to quickly evaluate and select appropriateprofiling methodologies. To increase designer productivity, we formulateprofiling methodology design guidelines based on extensive evaluationand analysis of a variety of profiling methodologies suitable fordynamically monitoring WSNs with respect to network traffic overhead,power, and code impacts associated with each method. While energyconsumption increases are reasonable, ranging from 0.5\\% to 2.6\\%,network traffic, code size, and computation time overheads can be ashigh as 66.2\\%, 75.9\\%, and 136.6\\%, respectively. Our results show thatthese overhead variations are highly application specific, and a singleprofiling method is not suitable for all types of application behavior,thus necessitating, application-specific profiling methodologycustomization. To facilitate rapid development of these profilingmethodologies, we present a profiler-customization methodologyconsisting of a code generator module, overhead estimation module, andprofile data management module. Using our profiling-customizationmethodology, designers can rapidly evaluate the overhead of differentprofiling methodologies, and automatically integrate the mostappropriate methodology into the application at design time.

Standard design and development techniques often fail toeffectively manage the complexity and dynamics of such systems. As aresult, there is a strong need for new programing models andabstractions. Towards this, component-based design methods are apromising solution. However, existing such approaches either do notaccurately model transitory interactions between components - which aretypical of cyber-physical systems - or do not provide guarantees forreal-time behavior which is essential in safety-critical applications.To overcome this problem, we present a component-based design techniquebased on DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components). The DEECoframework allows modeling large-scale dynamic systems by a set ofinteracting components and, in contrast to approaches from theliterature, it provides mechanisms to describe transitory interactionsbetween them. To allow reasoning about timing behavior at thecomponent-description level, we characterize DEECo's closed-loop delayin the worst case, i.e., the maximum time needed to react to a change inthe environment. Based on this, we incorporate real-time analysis intoDEECo's design flow. This further allows us to analyze the system'srobustness under unreliable communication and to design decentralizedsafety-preserving mechanisms. To illustrate the simplicity andusefulness of our approach, we present a case study consisting of anintelligent crossroad system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Operating system components and higher levelmiddleware services call for modular software construction along clearinterfaces. The way we describe these interfaces and process thecaptured information is of crucial importance for exploiting thebenefits of component-based design. In this paper we present a modelbased approach to the development of embedded applications with aspecial emphasis on interface specification. The proposed formalismcaptures the temporal and type aspects of interfaces and supports thecomposition and verification of components. Along with the formaldefinition of the proposed interface language and componentcompatibility rules, we present a modeling environment targeting TinyOS,a representative embedded operating system.

Then, a component-based design is performed. At softwaredesign time, software components yield embedded system functionality,and they also model hardware and mechanics functionality. As hardwareand mechanical parts are built, they are integrated with functionalitycomponents, already designed, written and verified. The criticalsoftware design task is splitting the embedded software functionalityand hardware model into self-contained, self-sufficient components, easyto manage simple interfaces. The concept is demonstrated by a case ofdesigning software for a potato fryer. Software components are designedto be transportable to other industrial kitchen appliances (bain-marie,tilting pan, range) via parameter adjustments only. In the case study ofa potato fryer, 90\\% of microcontroller code was implemented andverified as software components in a C++ Builder environment running ona personal computer at the same time as hardware and fryer mechanicalparts were built. 10\\% of code was written and final parameteradjustments were performed on a simple microcontroller developmentsystem.

Another approach tosimplifying software development is Component-Based SoftwareEngineering, which allows a system to be developed by reusablecomponents. Combining both approaches, we get component-baseddevelopment of multi-mode systems, for which a key issue is the modeswitch handling.

Component-based software engineering proved to be a promisingsolution for managing software complexity and allowing for reuse.However, there are several challenges inherent in the intersection ofresource efficiency and predictability of multi-core processors when itcomes to running component-based embedded software. In this paper, wepresent a software design framework addressing these challenges. Theframework includes both mapping of software components onto executabletasks, and the partitioning of the generated task set onto the cores ofa multi-core processor. This paper aims at enhancing resource efficiencyby optimizing the software design with respect to: 1) the inter-softwarecomponents communication cost, 2) the cost of synchronization amongdependent transactions of software components, and 3) the interaction ofsoftware components with the basic software services. An enginemanagement system, one of the most complex automotive sub-systems, isconsidered as a use case, and the experimental results show a reductionof up to 11.2\\% total CPU usage on a quad-core processor, in comparisonwith the common framework in the literature.

To understand or validate the behavior of such a system,one needs to understand the components involved in combination withunderstanding how they are configured and composed. This becomesincreasingly difficult when components are implemented in variousprogramming languages, and composition is specified in externalartifacts. Moreover, tooling that supports in-depth system-wide analysisof such heterogeneous systems is lacking.Objective: This paper contributes a method to analyze and visualizeinformation flow in a component based system at various levels ofabstraction. These visualizations are designed to support thecomprehension needs of both safety domain experts and softwaredevelopers for, respectively, certification and evolution ofsafety-critical cyber-physical systems.Method: We build system-wide dependence graphs and use static programslicing to determine all possible end-to-end information flows throughand across a system's components. We define a hierarchy of fiveabstractions over these information flows that reduce visual distractionand cognitive overload, while satisfying the users' information needs.We improve on our earlier work to provide interconnected views thatsupport both systematic, as well as opportunistic navigation scenarios.Results: We discuss the design and implementation of our approach andthe resulting views in a prototype tool called FlowTracker. We summarizethe results of a qualitative evaluation study, carried out via tworounds of interview, on the effectiveness and usability of these views.We discuss a number of improvements, such as more selective informationpresentations, that resulted from the evaluation.Conclusion: The evaluation shows that the proposed approach and viewsare useful for understanding and validating heterogeneouscomponent-based systems, and address information needs that couldearlier only be met by manual inspection of the source code. We discusslessons learned and directions for future work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.

The proposed solutionallows modelling and analysing component-based embedded softwareapplications that are defined using a specific pattern in which eachcomponent is executed by a task with a specific priority. Theinfrastructure is also capable of analysing the system performance whenthe tasks access shared resources, using either immediate priorityceiling, or priority inheritance protocols, in order to avoid thepriority inversion problem. The paper shows the set of rules that enablethe transformation between an application, compliant with the proposeddesign pattern, and its corresponding PCM. Finally, a use case examplebased on a real system, and a set of tests that validates the analysisinfrastructure, are provided.

The adoption of a sound software architecture provides crucial aid in conveniently apportioning the relevantdevelopment concerns. This paper takes a software-centeredinterpretation of the ISO 42010 notion of architecture, enhancing itwith a component model that attributes separate concerns to distinctdesign views. The component boundary becomes the border betweenfunctional and extrafunctional concerns. The latter are treated asdecorations placed on the outside of components, satisfied byimplementation artifacts separate from and composable with theimplementation of the component internals. The approach was evaluated byindustrial users from several domains, with remarkably positive results.(C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The protocol conformancechecking problem consists of determining whether the actual behavior ofa component conforms to the protocol specifications on its ports. Inthis paper, we consider this problem in the context of the model-drivendevelopment (MDD) of embedded systems based on UML 2, in which UML 2state machines are used to specify component behavior. We provide adefinition of conformance which slightly extends those found in theliterature and reduce the conformance check to a state spaceexploration. We describe a tool implementing the approach using the JavaPathFinder software model checker and the MDD tool IBM Rational RoseRT,discuss its application to three case studies, and show how the toolrepeatedly allowed us to find unexpected conformance errors withencouraging performance. We conclude that the approach is promising forsupporting the modular development of embedded components in the contextof industrial applications of MDD.

So, component models are adaptedtrying to minimize conflicts integrating real-time and dynamicbehaviors, and achieving components replacements in a bounded time. Oneof the main challenges for this is to calculate the required times bythe different operations needed in a component replacement. The otherissue is to know the operating times of the component in the system whentheir implementations change along the life of the system. In this workthe implementation of a component framework implementation is describedproviding a partial solution for these problems. A component model isprovided together with the corresponding algorithms to assure thatcomponents can be loaded and replaced at run-time without interfering intheir execution deadlines. The model is designed to avoid failuresduring component replacements. Finally a validation of the presentedconcepts is provided.

Finding the best software configuration with respect to multipleNFPs is a non-trivial task.Objective: We propose a Software Component Allocation Framework (SCAF)with the goal to acquire a (sub-) optimal software configuration withrespect to multiple NFPs, thus providing performance prediction of asoftware configuration in its early design phase. We focus on thesoftware configuration optimization for the average energy consumptionand average execution time.Method: We validated SCAF through its instantiation on a real-worlddemonstrator and a simulation. Firstly, we verified the correctness ofour model through comparing the performance prediction of six softwareconfigurations to the actual performance, obtained through extensivemeasurements with a confidence interval of 95\\%. Secondly, todemonstrate how SCAF scales up, we performed software configurationoptimization on 55 generated use-cases (with solution spaces rangingfrom 10(30) to 30(70)) and benchmark the results against best performingrandom configurations.Results: The performance of a configuration as predicted by ourframework matched the configuration implemented and measured on areal-world platform. Furthermore, by applying the genetic algorithm andsimulated annealing to the weight function given in SCAF, we obtainsub-optimal software configurations differing in performance at most 7\\%and 13\\% from the optimal configuration (respectfully).Conclusion: SCAF is capable of correctly describing a HC platform andreliably predict the performance of software configuration in the earlydesign phase. Automated in the form of an Eclipse plugin, SCAF allowssoftware architects to model architectural constraints and preferences,acting as a multi-criterion software architecture decision supportsystem. In addition to said, we also point out several interestingresearch directions, to further investigate and improve our approach.

In this context,it is hard to build confidence that a design solution fulfills theapplication's requirements. This paper introduces a design flow for webservice applications of the representational state transfer style thatis based on a formal modeling language, the behaviour, interaction,priority (BIP) component framework. The proposed flow applies theprinciples of separation of concerns in a component-based design processthat supports the modular design and reuse of model artifacts. The BIPtools for state-space exploration allow verifying qualitative propertiesfor service responsiveness, ie, the timely handling of events. Moreover,essential quantitative properties are validated through statisticalmodel checking of a stochastic BIP model. All properties are preservedin actual implementation by ensuring that the deployed code isconsistent with the validated model.

We presenta service composition system that enables the goal-driven configurationof smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata andreasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-drivenapproaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use ofembedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups thatfulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its highdegree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamicenvironments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual servicesbecoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, weintegrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows tomodel the desired state of a smart environment graphically, therebyhiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possibleapplications of the presented system include the management of smarthomes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smartenvironments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcaredomains.Note to Practitioners-Machine tooling times are an important factorespecially when producing small batch sizes. Our approach holds thepotential to have manufacturing lines reconfigure themselves at runtime,based on descriptions of the functionality of individual devices. It caneven consider properties that influence the process indirectly({''}nonfunctional{''}), such as the time or monetary cost of a process.We additionally implemented a system that makes these rather complexdescriptions understandable for nonspecialists.

We define a new semantics ofreconfigurations that allow automatic improvements of systemperformances at run-time even if there are no hardware faults. We applythis new semantics on two Benchmark Production Systems developed in ourresearch laboratory according to this industrial technology. We classifythereafter into three forms all possible reconfiguration scenarios to beapplied at run-time by a well-defined agent in order to adapt the systemto its environment according to well-defined conditions. The agent ismodelled by nested state machines according to the formalism NetCondition/Event Systems (NCES) which is an extension of Petri nets. Inorder to satisfy user requirements, we specify functional andnon-functional properties according to the well-known temporal logic``Computation Tree Logic{''} (CTL) as well as its extensions eCTL andTCTL, and we apply the model checker SESA to check the whole agent-basedarchitecture of the reconfigurable system.

In addition tosupporting the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of individual DREsystems, component technologies must also support bounded latencies wheneffecting deployment changes to DRE systems in response to changingenvironmental conditions and operational requirements.Objective: The goals of this paper are to (1) study sources ofinefficiencies and non-deterministic performance in deploymentcapabilities for DRE systems and (2) devise solutions to overcome theseperformance problems.Method: The paper makes two contributions to the study of the deploymentand configuration of distributed component based applications. First, weanalyze how conventional implementations of the OMG's Deployment andConfiguration (D\\&amp;C) specification for component-based systems cansignificantly degrade deployment latencies. Second, we describearchitectural changes and performance optimizations implemented withinthe Locality-Enhanced Deployment and Configuration Engine (LE-DAnCE)implementation of the D\\&amp;C specification to obtain efficient anddeterministic deployment latencies.Results: We analyze the performance of LE-DAnCE in the context ofcomponent deployments on 10 nodes for a representative DRE systemconsisting of 1000 components and in a cluster environment with up to100 nodes. Our results show LE-DAnCE's optimizations provide a boundeddeployment latency of less than 2 s for the 1000 component scenario withjust a 4 percent jitter.Conclusion: The improvements contained in the LE-DAnCE infrastructureprovide an efficient and scaleable standards-based deployment system forcomponent-based enterprise DRE systems. In particular, deployment timeparallelism can improve deployment latency significantly, both duringpre-deployment analysis of the deployment plan and during the process ofinstalling and activating components.

The research on component-based systemshas produced component technologies for guaranteeing real-timeproperties. However, the issue of saving resources by allocating severalcomponents to real-time tasks has gained little focus. Trade-offs whenallocating components to tasks are, e.g., CPU-overhead, footprint andintegrity. In this paper we present a general approach for allocatingcomponents to real-time tasks, while utilizing existing real-timeanalysis to ensure a feasible allocation. We demonstrate thatCPU-overhead and memory consumption can be reduced by as much as 48\\%and 32\\% respectively for industrially representative systems.

CPPSs require acquisitionof production system data and smart data processing to extractinformation to improve the overall system performance. To achieve thatit is needed to bridge the gap between the control systems and higherlayers. This paper discusses an approach to use the IEC 61499 functionblock concept to exchange data between plant floor and higher layersusing an industrial standard like OPC UA. The OPC UA server offerssubscription mechanisms, making possible the integration of severalresources residing at plant floor. As it runs on embedded devices, theproposal makes possible to acquire plant information at low cost,enabling at the same time, a component-based design for enterprise plantfloor control with independence of the hardware platform used Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS); Industry 4.0; OPC-UA;Modbus/TCP</td><td>embedded devices</td><td>embedded devices</td><td>embedded devic</td></tr>\n",

Data aggregation approaches havebeen widely used to enhance the performance of IoT applications. Suchapproaches reduce the number of packets that are transmitted bycombining multiple packets into one transmission unit, therebyminimising energy consumption, collisions and congestion. However,current data aggregation schemes restrict developers to a specificnetwork structure or cannot handle multi-hop data aggregation. In thispaper, we propose Hitch Hiker 2.0, a component binding model thatprovides support for multi-hop data aggregation. Hitch Hiker usescomponent meta-data to discover remote component bindings and toconstruct a multi-hop overlay network within the free payload space ofexisting traffic flows. Hitch Hiker 2.0 provides end-to-end routing oflow-priority traffic while using only a small fraction of the energy ofstandard communication. This paper extends upon our previous work byincorporating new mechanisms for decentralised route discovery andproviding additional application case studies and evaluation. We havedeveloped a prototype implementation of Hitch Hiker for the LooCIcomponent model. Our evaluation shows that Hitch Hiker consumes minimalresources and that using Hitch Hiker to deliver low-priority trafficreduces energy consumption by up to 32 \\%.

Their users range from everyday commuters to policy makers andurban planners. Given the complexity of these systems and theirenvironment, their study in real settings is frequently unfeasible.Simulations help to address this problem, but present their own issues:there can be unintended mistakes in the transition from models to code;their platforms frequently bias modeling; and it is difficult to compareworks that use different models and tools. In order to overcome theseproblems, this paper proposes a framework for a model-driven developmentof these simulations. It is based on a specific modeling language thatsupports the integrated specification of the multiple facets of an ITS:people, their vehicles, and the external environment; and a network ofsensors and actuators conveniently arranged and distributed thatoperates over them. The framework works with a model editor to generatespecifications compliant with that language, and a code generator toproduce code from them using platform specifications.

Endogenous resilience is the inherent abilityof the system to detect and process internal faults and maliciousattacks. Exogenous resilience is the permanent capability of the systemto maintain a safe operation within its ambient environment. In thispaper, we present a predictive dual-sided contract-based formalmethodology to address both aspects of resilience on top of adistributed object-oriented component-based software model. It isillustrated by a case study of urban drone rescue systems. We exploitthe formalism of timed automata and the toolbox UPPAAL to predict byabstraction and analyze (simulate and verify) endogenous resilience.Instead of presenting the final models of the case study, we reflect ourexperience with UPPAAL in generic patterns of system design and contractspecification, reusable in other contexts with adaptations. The analysisof exogenous resilience is specific to the considered drone rescuesystem. It consists of synthesizing by iterative model-checking safefiight paths for the drones within a 3D virtual model of urbansurroundings true to modern cities.

The goal is tocheck the agent reactivity after any evolution of the environment.Several complex networks can implement the system, where each one isexecuted at a given time when a corresponding reconfiguration scenariois automatically applied by the agent. To check the correctness of eachone of them, we apply in several steps a refinement-based approach thatautomatically specifies feasible Control Components according to NCES.The model checker SESA is automatically applied in each step to verifydeadlock properties of new generated components, and it is manually usedto verify CTL-based properties according to user requirements. Weimplement the reconfiguration agent by three modules that allowinterpretations of environment evolutions, decisions of usefulreconfiguration scenarios, and finally, their applications. TwoIndustrial Benchmark Production Systems FESTO and EnAS available in ourresearch laboratory are applied to explain the contributions of thepaper.

Furthermore, the DSP development tools available today areless advanced than in other embedded software design. This has lead toDSP software architectures that have not taken into account futureexpansion needs. Therefore, DSP software architectures have beeninherently closed. Now, as system complexity increases, this designmethodology becomes more of a burden, since it does not supportcomponent-based DSP software development that requires open interfaces.In this paper, mobile-communications DSP software architectures arestudied as cases, and key areas for improvements towards more open DSPsoftware development are identified.

Because WSN nodes are typicallybattery equipped, the primary design goal of the models is to optimizethe amount of energy used for data transmission while retaining dataaccuracy at high levels.

Inthis context, component-based design seems the more promising approach,but it suffers from the lack of a widely adopted Model of Computation(MoC) able to capture component heterogeneity. This paper proposesUNIVERCM, a new model of computation based on the HeterogeneousIntermediate Format (HIF) with the aim of supporting bottom-up designand system integration from a set of heterogeneous components. HW and SWcomponents can be described by means of different languages andaccording to different MoCs, toward a uniform intermediate descriptionbased on a rigorous semantics.

These mismatches, if notprevented during system design, have to be tolerated during runtime.This paper presents an architectural abstraction based on exceptionhandling for structuring fault-tolerant software systems. Thisabstraction comprises several components and connectors that promote anexisting untrusted software element into an idealised fault-tolerantarchitectural element. Moreover, it is considered in the context of arigorous software development approach based on formal methods forrepresenting the structure and behaviour of the software architecture.The proposed approach relies on a formal specification and verificationfor analysing exception propagation, and verifying importantdependability properties, such as deadlock freedom, and scenarios ofarchitectural reconfiguration. The formal models are automaticallygenerated using model transformation from UML diagrams: componentdiagram representing the system structure, and sequence diagramsrepresenting the system behaviour. Finally, the formal models are alsoused for generating unit and integration test cases that are used forassessing the correctness of the source code. The feasibility of theproposed architectural approach was evaluated on an embedded criticalcase study. exception handling; fault-tolerant software architecture; model-basedtest; model checking; software verification and validation</td><td>formal specification </td><td>formal specification </td><td>formal specif</td></tr>\n",

The implicit approach usually outperforms theexplicit one, both in terms of time and memory.This paper introduces an implicit and component-based method for thesteady-state solution of reducible Markov regenerative processes: thestrongly connected components of the characteristic matrices of theprocess are used to identify a structure of components that is exploitedby the solution process to discriminate components of the process thathave a simple or a complex structure, and corresponding lower and highersolution costs. The solution then considers one component at a time,applying to each of them the simplest solution technique adequate to theactual component complexity. An implicit approach is followed, whichsaves the cost of building and storing the EMC, but makes non trivialthe identification of the strongly connected components.The paper shows the efficacy of the method both in theory and on a setof MRPs arising from queueing networks, stochastic Petri nets and fromthe stochastic model checking of Markov chains. In particular it isshown that the cost of the model checking of the Until formula of thestochastic logic CSLTA reduces to that of CSL if the component method isused. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Asmicroprocessors become more powerful, the software complexity ofreal-time embedded systems has increased steadily. The requirements forincreased functionality and adaptability make the development ofreal-time embedded software complex and error-prone. Component-baseddesign has been widely accepted as a compositional approach tofacilitate the design of complex systems. It provides a means fordecomposing a complex system into simpler subsystems and composing thesubsystems in a hierarchical manner. A system composed of real-timesubsystems with hierarchy is called a hierarchical real-time system.This paper describes a process algebraic approach to schedulabilityanalysis of hierarchical real-time systems. To facilitate modeling andanalyzing hierarchical real-time systems, we conservatively extend anexisting process algebraic theory based on ACSR-VP (Algebra ofCommunicating Shared Resources with Value-Passing) for theschedulability of real-time systems. We explain a method to model aresource model in ACSR-VP which may be partitioned for a subsystem. Wealso introduce schedulability relation to define the schedulability ofhierarchical real-time systems and show that satisfaction checking ofthe relation is reducible to deadlock checking in ACSR-VP and can bedone automatically by the tool support of VERSA (Verification, Executionand Rewrite System for ACSR).

Unlike some works which study the connection between formalapproaches and the highest (decisional) level of the robot softwarearchitecture, where deliberative activities such as planning,diagnostics, and execution control are conducted, we tackle the problemof using formal methods for developing modules of the functional levelof robots. Little attention has been drawn to the development of thesemodules whose robustness is paramount to the robustness of the overallplatform.To this end, we have successfully developed the G(theta n)oM/BIPcomponent based design approach and applied it to the functional levelof a complex exploration rover. Here, we report on this work, and showhow we: (i) produce a very fine grained formal computational model ofthe robot functional level; (ii) run the SIP engine on the real robot,which executes and enforces the model semantics at runtime; and (iii)check the model offline for deadlock-freedom, as well as other safetyproperties.Moreover, we also extended this paradigm in a number of promisingdirections: (i) introduced a real-time BIP engine which can now use andcontrol a timed BIP model; (ii) distributed the model and the engineover multiple CPUs: (iii) proposed a user-friendly language forspecifying constraints on the model; and (iv) linked the model with atemporal plan execution controller. Interestingly, although our approachwas initially proposed for the lowest level of robot architectures,these more recent extensions now allow us to model and manage thedeliberation taking place at the decisional layer.

The current tools offeredby IoT and home automation vendors lack in emulation features close tothe real behavior of the devices. In many cases, delaying theverification actions until the hardware is acquired and installed maycause some drawbacks, for example, from the economic point of view. Thispaper presents a solution for emulating home automation environmentswhich are based on the KNX standard and can be represented byarchitectures of devices. The emulation consist of developing virtualimplementations of real devices which operate and communicate throughweb technology. The technology implementing these virtual devices allowsus to develop components which can provide different type of datarelated to the installation (audio, video, text, animations, images,etc.). The architectures can be managed using web services and theirbehavior can be tested through web user interfaces showing the mentioneddata. Furthermore, virtual and physical devices are connected tovalidate the interoperability between the real installation and theemulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, they break with the traditional layered architecturethat has been so successful for over 30 years. A fully fledgedcross-layer stack requires a sophisticated software design to bemaintainable and reusable. The Trustful Space-Time Protocol (TSTP) is across-layer protocol designed to deliver authenticated, encrypted,timed, and georeferenced messages containing data compliant with theInternational System of Units (SI) in a resource-efficient way. Byintegrating shared data from multiple networking services into a singlecommunication infrastructure, TSTP is able to eliminate replication ofinformation across services, achieving small overhead regarding controlmessages. The complexity of TSTP's features, its broad range - from theapplication to the Medium Access Control, - and its experimental naturebring diverse requirements beyond those usually considered in mostsoftware designs. In this work, we show how we avoided a monolithicimplementation of the cross-layer approach with a component-baseddesign, exploring template metaprogramming techniques to adapt andcombine basic building blocks. An event-driven architecture that makesuse of zero copy buffers and metadata is used to handle crosscuttingconcerns. We validate the proposed design with an implementation forIEEE 802.15.4 networks and a set of OMNet++ simulations for relevantscenarios, showing that we achieve a light TSTP implementation that issuccessfully able to save energy and bandwidth while keeping a deliveryratio close to 100\\%.

Unanticipatedquality defects in a component can be a major source of system failure.To address this issue, this paper suggests a design verificationapproach integrated into the model-driven, component-based developmentmethodology Marmot. The notion of abstract components-the basic buildingblocks of Marmot-helps to lift the level of abstraction, facilitateshigh-level reuse, and reduces verification complexity by localizingverification problems between abstract components before refinement andafter refinement. This enables the identification of unanticipateddesign errors in the early stages of development. This work introducesthe Marmot methodology, presents a design verification approach inMarmot, and demonstrates its application on the development of amu-controller-based abstraction of a car mirror control system. Anapplication on TinyOS shows that the approach helps to reuse models aswell as their verification results in the development process.

Major improvements in acute care and diagnostics have created atendency toward the chronification of formerly terminal conditions,requiring people with these conditions to learn how to self-manage.Mobile technologies hold promise as self-management tools due to theirubiquity and cost-effectiveness. The delivery of health-related servicesthrough mobile technologies (mobile health, mHealth) has grownexponentially in recent years. However, only a fraction of thesesolutions take into consideration the views of relevant stakeholderssuch as health care professionals or even patients. The use ofbehavioral change models (BCMs) has proven important in developingsuccessful health solutions, yet engaging patients remains a challenge.There is a trend in mHealth solutions called gamification that attemptsto use game elements to drive user behavior and increase engagement. Asit stands, designers of mHealth solutions for behavioral change inchronic conditions have no clear way of deciding what factors arerelevant to consider.Objective: The goal of this work is to discover factors for the designof mHealth solutions for chronic patients using negotiations betweenmedical knowledge, BCMs, and gamification.Methods: This study uses an embedded case study research methodologyconsisting of 4 embedded units: 1) cross-sectional studies of mHealthapplications; 2) statistical analysis of gamification presence; 3) focusgroups and interviews to relevant stakeholders; and 4) research throughdesign of an mHealth solution. The data obtained was thematicallyanalyzed to create a conceptual model for the design of mHealthsolutions.Results: The Model for Motivational Mobile-health Design (3MD) forchronic conditions guides the design of condition-oriented gamifiedbehavioral change mHealth solutions. The main components are (1)condition specific, which describe factors that need to be adjusted andadapted for each particular chronic condition; (2) motivation related,which are factors that address how to influence behaviors in an engagingmanner; and (3) technology based, which are factors that are directlyconnected to the technical capabilities of mobile technologies. The 3MDalso provides a series of high-level illustrative design questions fordesigners to use and consider during the design process.Conclusions: This work addresses a recognized gap in research andpractice, and proposes a unique model that could be of use in thegeneration of new solutions to help chronic patients. chronic conditions; consumer health informatics; gamification; healthbehavioral change; medical informatics; mHealth; user-centered design;information systems</td><td>Chronic conditions</td><td>chronic conditions</td><td>chronic condit</td></tr>\n",

Within this context, this papertargets the challenges that are concerned with the unambiguousrefinement of timing requirements, constraints and other timinginformation among various abstraction levels. Such information isrequired by the end-to-end timing analysis engines to providepre-run-time verification about the predictability of these systems. Thepaper proposes an approach to represent and refine such informationamong various abstraction levels. As a proof of concept, the approachprovides a representation of the timing information at the higher levelsusing the models that are developed with EAST-ADL and Timing AugmentedDescription Language. The approach then refines the timing informationfor the lower abstraction levels. The approach exploits the RubusComponent Model at the lower level to represent the timing informationthat cannot be clearly specified at the higher levels, such as triggerpaths in distributed chains. A vehicular-application case study isconducted to show the applicability of the proposed approach.

To ensure code quality and reliability,computer-aided analysis is also performed for the generated applicationsoftware in some frameworks. However, when the target is real-timeembedded systems, the correctness of the software in terms of satisfyingall user-given real-time and embedded constraints becomes a primaryobjective for such frameworks. To guarantee correctness, formalverification in the form of model checking is a viable solution due toits full automation capability. Nevertheless, little is known fromeither the existing literature or industrial experience on how formalverification can be integrated into an object-oriented applicationframework, whose primary purpose was previously only to design andgenerate application software. This work contributes to the state-of-arttechnology by showing how a design framework and a verificationframework can be integrated. Three main issues are tackled: (i) what toverify?; (ii) when to verify?; and (iii) how to verify? As a solution tothese three issues the authors propose a mapping from theobject-oriented model to a formal model, a schedule-verify-map strategyand a compositional verification methodology, respectively. These havebeen implemented in a component-based framework and experimentsperformed to illustrate their feasibility. Due to the incorporation ofindustry de-facto standards such as real-time unified modelling languageand real-time Java, in the proposed techniques it should now be possiblefor an engineer to gain access to theoretically proven formalverification technologies that would otherwise be considered to beinaccessible to an engineer unskilled in verification techniques.

Passive replication minimizes resourceconsumption by only activating redundant replicas in case of failures,as typically, providing and applying state updates is less resourcedemanding than requesting execution. However, most existing solutionsfor passive fault tolerance are usually designed and configured atdesign time, explicitly and statically identifying the most criticalcomponents and their number of replicas, lacking the needed flexibilityto handle the runtime dynamics of distributed component-based embeddedsystems. This paper proposes a cost-effective adaptive fault tolerancesolution with a significant lower overhead compared to a strict activeredundancy-based approach, achieving a high error coverage with aminimum amount of redundancy. The activation of passive replicas iscoordinated through a feedback-based coordination model that reduces thecomplexity of the needed interactions among components until a newcollective global service solution is determined, hence improving theoverall maintainability and robustness of the system.

This paper makes three contributions toR\\&amp;D on component-based fault-tolerance.

However,existing approaches have critical weakness. First, existing approachestypically require a component's source code to be available if you wishto strip (or re-insert) checks. Second, documentation of the contract iseither distributed separately from the component or embedded in thecomponent's source code. Third, enabling and disabling specific kinds ofchecks on separate components from independent vendors can be asignificant challenge. This paper describes an approach to representingcontracts for .NET components using attributes. This contractinformation can be retrived from the compiled component's metadata andused for many purposes. The paper also describes nContract, a tool thatautomatically generates run-time checks from embedded contracts. Suchrun-time checks can be generated and added to a system withoutrequiringt source code access or recompilation. Further, when checks fora given component are excluded, they impose no run-time overhead.Finally, a highly expressive, fine-grained mechanism for controllinguser preferences about which specific checks are enabled or disabled ispresented. design by contract; assertion checkers; dynamic verification;component-based software; binary components; preconditions;postconditions; invariants; coding techniques; debugging aids;specification</td><td>design contract</td><td>design contract</td><td>design contract</td></tr>\n",

However, standard componentmodels and tools are not suitable for this type of system, since they donot explicitly address real time, memory or cost constraints. This paperpresents a new predictable component model for real-time systems(UM-RTCOM) together with a set of tools to support it. The environmentallows new components to be developed which can then be assembled tobuild complete applications, including hardware interaction. The modelincludes support for real-time analysis at the component and applicationlevel. The analysis is achieved by combining component meta-informationin the form of an abstract behaviour model and a method to measureworst-case execution times in the final platform. Additionally, wepropose an implementation model based on RT-CORBA where the developeruses the UM-RTCOM components and a set of tools to map these elements toelements of the desired platform. In order to apply our proposals, wehave used the model and tools in real applications specifically in thecontext of nuclear power plant simulators. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This paper investigates the use ofonline MPC, in which at each step, an optimization problem is solved, onboth a programmable automation controller (PAC) and a programmable logiccontroller (PLC). Three different optimization routines to solve thequadratic program were investigated with respect to their applicabilityon these devices. To this end, an air heating setup was built andselected as a small-scalemulti-input single-output system. It turns outthat the code generator (CVXGEN) is not suited for the PLC as therequired programming language is not available and the programmingconcept with preallocated memory consumes too much memory. The Hildrethand qpOASES algorithms successfully controlled the setup running on thePLC hardware. Both algorithms perform similarly, although it takes moretime to calculate a solution for qpOASES. However, if the problem sizeincreases, it is expected that the high number of required iterationswhen the constraints are hit will cause the Hildreth algorithm to exceedthe necessary time to present a solution. For this small heating problemunder test, the Hildreth algorithm is selected as most useful on a PLC.

While theharvested power is often less than 1 mW, the commercial-off-the-shelfpower management circuits designed for conventional battery applicationsoperate in much higher power. A designated power management module forsub-mW energy harvester is proposed in this article to increase theenergy conversion efficiency and extend the energy storage lifetime forsmall input power. The proposed module consists of discretecomponent-based pulse-width modulation (PWM) controlled synchronousboost converter structured impedance matching circuit andsupercapacitor/micro-battery hybrid energy storage. The synchronousboost converter-based power management circuit achieves 79\\% conversionefficiency at the input power of 0.5 mW. The power loss during theenergy conversion is significantly reduced and thus allows wirelesssensor nodes to be powered from a minimum of 120 Lux fluorescent lightwith a photovoltaic cell smaller than a credit card. Thesupercapacitor/micro-battery energy storage provides lifetime of morethan 73 h when no external energy is available. The experimental resultswith 25 energy harvester-powered wireless sensor nodes demonstrate thatthe practical ultra-low-power design makes sub-1-mW energy harvesterpower management applicable.

If a reconfiguration scenario is appliedat run-time, then the FB network implementing the application is totallychanged or modified. To cover all possible cases, we classify suchscenarios into three classes and we define an agent-based architecturedesigned with nested state machines to automatically handle all possiblereconfigurations. To verify and assign Function Blocks corresponding toeach reconfiguration scenario into the execution environment, we definean approach based on the exploration of reachability graphs to verifytemporal properties. This approach constructs feasible Operating Systemtasks encoding the FB network that corresponds to each scenario.Therefore, the application is considered as sets of Operating System(OS) tasks where each set is to load in memory when the correspondingreconfiguration scenario is applied by the agent.

These goals are at odds, and compilers can only rarelytranslate expressive high-level programs to modern hardware platforms ina way that makes best use of the available resources.Generative programming is a promising alternative to fully automatictranslation. Instead of writing down the target program directly,developers write a program generator, which produces the target programas its output. The generator can be written in a high-level, genericstyle and can still produce efficient, specialized target programs. Inpractice, however, developing high-quality program generators requires avery large effort that is often hard to amortize.We present lightweight modular staging (LMS), a generative programmingapproach that lowers this effort significantly. LMS seamlessly combinesprogram generator logic with the generated code in a single program,using only types to distinguish the two stages of execution. Throughextensive use of component technology, LMS makes a reusable andextensible compiler framework available at the library level, allowingprogrammers to tightly integrate domain-specific abstractions andoptimizations into the generation process, with common genericoptimizations provided by the framework.LMS is well suited to develop embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs)and has been used to develop powerful performance-oriented DSLs fordemanding domains such as machine learning, with code generation forheterogeneous platforms including GPUs. LMS has also been used togenerate SQL for embedded database queries and JavaScript for webapplications. NA</td><td>high performance</td><td>high performance</td><td>high perform</td></tr>\n",

Without complementary verification andcertification methods the benefits of these development techniques arereduced. As part of certification, it is necessary to show a system isacceptably safe which subsumes both the normal and abnormal (failure)cases. However, nonfunctional properties, such as safety and failures,are abstraction breakers, cutting across multiple components. Also, muchof the work on component-based engineering has been applied tosoftware-based systems rather than field programmable gate array(FPGA)-based systems whose use is becoming more popular in industry. Inthis paper, we show how a modular design embedded on a FPGA can beexhaustively analyzed (from a safety perspective) to derive the failureand safety properties to give the evidence needed for a safety case. Thespecific challenges faced are analyzing the fault characteristics ofindividual electronic components, combining the results across softwaremodules, and then feeding this into a system safety case. A secondarybenefit of taking this approach is that there is less uncertainty in theperformance of the device, hence, it can be used for higher integritysystems.

In contrast, it iscommon to use shared library functions and construct vertically layeredsoftware for efficiency and modularity. To fill this gap betweenmodeling and implementation, we propose a special actor, library task,with new types of ports: library master port and library slave port. Itis a sharable and mappable object that defines a set of functioninterfaces inside. N:1 master-slave connection allows sharing a librarytask and the master-slave connection can specify vertically layeredsoftware and client-server applications naturally.To support the library task in our embedded software design environment,we develop an automatic mapping algorithm as well as an automatic codegenerator.

Unfortunately, theirhardware-driven design concept results in long development cycles andimpedes their acceptance in industrial practice. Additionally, theverification of the FPGA's correctness and its performance figures areunavailable until a very late development stage, which is criticalduring design space exploration and the integration in complex embeddedsystems. Weakly-programmable architectures, supporting design andrun-time reuse via flexible hardware components, represent a promisingand efficient FPGA development approach. However, they currently lacksuitable design and verification methodologies for real-time scenarios.Therefore, this paper proposes a system-level FPGA development conceptfor video applications with weakly-programmable hardware components. Itcombines rapid software prototyping with component-based FPGA design andadvanced formal real-time analysis and code generation techniques. Thepresented approach enables an early verification of the application'scorrectness, including exact performance figures. It provides asoftware-level verification of weakly-programmable hardware componentsand an automated assembly of the final hardware design. The developedtools and their usability are demonstrated by a binarization and a denseblock matching application, which represents a basic preprocessing stepin automotive image processing for driver assistance systems.

When considering resilient embedded systems that must complywith stringent dependability requirements, the challenge is evengreater, as evolution must not impair dependability attributes.Maintaining dependability properties when facing changes is, indeed, theexact definition of resilient computing. In this paper, we consider theevolution of systems with respect to their dependability mechanisms andshow how such mechanisms can evolve with the system evolution, in thecase of ROS, the robot operating system. We provide a synthesis of theconcepts required for resilient computing using a component-basedapproach. We particularly emphasize the process and the techniquesneeded to implement an adaptation layer for fault tolerance mechanisms.In the light of this analysis, we address the implementation of adaptivefault tolerance on ROS in 2 steps: Firstly, we provide an architectureto implement fault tolerance mechanisms in ROS, and secondly, wedescribe the actual adaptation of fault tolerance mechanisms in ROS.Beyond the implementation details given in the paper, we draw thelessons learned from this work and discuss the limits of this run-timesupport to implement adaptive fault tolerance features in embeddedsystems. adaptive fault tolerance; resilience; ROS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>system evolution</td><td>system evolution</td><td>system evolut</td></tr>\n",

Decisions made during this phase impact the quality, cost,performance, and the delivery date of the final product. Over the pastdecade or more, various partitioning approaches have been proposed. Amajority operate at a relatively fine granularity and use a low-levelexecutable specification as the starting point. This presents problemsif the context is families of industrial products with frequent releaseof upgraded or new members. Managing complexity using a low-levelspecification is extremely challenging and impacts developerproductivity. Designing using a high-level specification andcomponent-based development, although a better option, imposes componentintegration and replacement problems during system evolution and newproduct release. A new approach termed Concept-Based Partitioning ispresented that focuses on system evolution, product lines, andlarge-scale reuse when partitioning. Beginning with information from UML2.0 sequence diagrams and a concept repository concepts are identifiedand used as the unit of partitioning within a specification. Amethodology for the refinement of interpart communication in the systemspecification using sequence diagrams is also presented. Changelocalization during system evolution, composability during large-scalereuse, and provision for configurable feature variations for a productline are facilitated by a Generic Adaptive Layer (GAL) around selectedconcepts. The methodology was applied on a subsystem of an UnmannedAerial Vehicle (UAV) using various concepts which improved thecomposability of concepts while keeping performance and size overheadwithin the 2\\% range.

They increase confidence andpotentially provide rich feedback. However, with increasing complexity,verification tools themselves are more likely to contain errors.In contrast to automatic verification tools, higher-order theoremprovers use mathematically founded proof strategies checked by a smallproof checker to guarantee selected properties. Thus, they enjoy a highlevel of trustability. Properties of software and hardware systems andtheir justifications can be encapsulated into a certificate, therebyguaranteeing correctness of the systems, with respect to the properties.These results offer a much higher degree of confidence than resultsachieved by verification tools. However, higher-order theorem proversare usually slow, due to their general and minimalistic nature. Even forsmall systems, a lot of human interaction is required for establishing acertificate.In this work, we combine the advantages of automatic verification tools(i.e., speed and automation) with those of higher-order theorem provers(i.e., high level of trustability). The verification tool generates acertificate for each invocation. This is checked by the higher-ordertheorem prover, thereby guaranteeing the desired property. Thegeneration of certificates is much easier than producing the analysisresults of the verification tool in the first place. In our work, we areable to create certificates that come with an algorithmic description ofthe proof of the desired property as justification. We concentrate onverification tools that generate invariants of systems and certifyautomatically that these do indeed hold. Our approach is applied to thecertification of the verdicts of a deadlock-detection tool for anasynchronous component-based language.

Reducingthe energy overheads of sensor data acquisition and processing isessential to ensure the successful continuous operation of suchapplications, especially on battery-limited mobile devices. To achievethis goal, this paper presents a framework, called ACQUA, for`acquisition-cost' aware continuous query processing. ACQUA replaces thecurrent paradigm, where the data is typically streamed (pushed) from thesensors to the one or more smartphones, with a pull-based asynchronousmodel, where a smartphone retrieves appropriate blocks of relevantsensor data from individual sensors, as an integral part of the queryevaluation process. We describe algorithms that dynamically optimize thesequence (for complex stream queries with conjunctive and disjunctivepredicates) in which such sensor data streams are retrieved by the queryevaluation component, based on a combination of (a) the communicationcost \\&amp; selectivity properties of individual sensor streams, and (b) theoccurrence of the stream predicates in multiple concurrently executingqueries. We also show how a transformation of a group of stream queriesinto a disjunctive normal form provides us with significantly greaterdegrees of freedom in choosing this sequence, in which individual sensorstreams are retrieved and evaluated. While the algorithms can apply to abroad category of sensor-based applications, we specifically demonstratetheir application to a scenario where multiple stream processing queriesexecute on a single smartphone, with the sensors transferring their dataover an appropriate PAN technology, such as Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11.Extensive simulation experiments indicate that ACQUA's intelligentbatch-oriented data acquisition process can result in as much as 80 \\%reduction in the energy overhead of continuous query processing, withoutany loss in the fidelity of the processing logic.

Typically, suchsystems consist of embedded computers that monitor and control physicalprocesses in a feedback loop. While modern electronic systems areincreasingly characterized as CPS, their design and synthesis still relyon traditional methods, which lack systematic and automated techniquesfor accomplishment.Recently, IEC 61499 has been proposed as a standard for designingindustrial process-control and measurement systems. It prescribes acomponent-based approach for developing industrial automation softwareusing function blocks. Executable code can then be automaticallygenerated and simulated from these function blocks. This bodes well fordesigners of CPS, who are more likely to be experts in specificindustrial domains, rather than in computer science. The intuitivegraphical nature and automatic code synthesis of IEC 61499 programs willalleviate the programming burden of industrial engineers, while ensuringmore reliable software. While software synthesis from IEC 61499 programsis not new the generation of efficient code from them has been wanting.This has made it difficult for function blocks to be used in softwaredevelopment for resource-constrained embedded controllers commonlyemployed in CPS. To address this, we present an approach that cangenerate very efficient code from function block descriptions.Experimental results from a benchmark suite shows that our approachproduces substantially faster and smaller code compared to existingtechniques.

In this paper, weintroduce a novel model-based approach for constructing correctdistributed implementation of component-based models constrained bypriorities. We argue that model-based methods are especially of interestin the context of distributed embedded systems due to their inherentcomplexity (e.g., caused by non-deterministic nature of distributedsystems). Our method is designed based on three phases oftransformation. The input is a model specified in terms of a set ofbehavioral components that interact through a set of high-levelsynchronization primitives (e.g., rendezvous and broadcasts) andpriority rules for scheduling purposes. The first phase transforms theinput model into a model that has no priorities. Then, the second phasetransforms the deprioritized model into another model that resolvesdistributed conflicts by incorporating a solution to the committeecoordination problem. Finally, the third phase generates distributedcode using asynchronous point-to-point message passing primitives (e.g.,TCP sockets). All transformations preserve the properties of their inputmodel by ensuring observational equivalence. All the transformations areimplemented and our experiments validate their effectiveness.

In this paper, asoftware interface that enables the java-digital signal processing(J-DSP) visual programming environment to communicate in a two-waymanner with a wireless sensor network is presented. This interface wasdeveloped by writing nesC (an extension to the C programming languagefor sensors) code that enables J-DSP to issue commands to multiplewireless sensor motes, activate specific transducers, and analyze datausing any of the existing J-DSP signal processing functions in realtime. A series of exercises were developed and disseminated to providehardware experiences to signals and systems and signal processingundergraduate students. The hardware with the J-DSP software has beenused for two semesters in the senior level digital signal processing(DSP) course at Arizona State University.

In this paper, based onadvanced information \\&amp; communication technologies (ICT) and greentechnologies (GT) concepts, a dedicated public urban transportationservice access system named Mobi+ has been introduced, which facilitatesthe mobility of DWB passengers. The Mobi+ project consists of threesubsystems: a wireless communication subsystem, which provides the dataexchange and network connection services between buses and stations inthe complex urban environments; the bus subsystem, which provides theDWB class detection \\&amp; bus arrival notification services; and thestation subsystem, which implements the urban environmental surveillance\\&amp; bus auxiliary access services. The Mobi+ card that supportsmulti-microcontroller multi-transceiver adopts the fault-tolerantcomponent-based hardware architecture, in which the dedicated embeddedsystem software, i.e., operating system micro-kernel and wirelessprotocol, has been integrated. The dedicated Mobi+ embedded systemprovides the fault-tolerant resource awareness communication andscheduling mechanism to ensure the reliability in data exchange andservice provision. At present, the Mobi+ system has been implemented onthe buses and stations of line `2' in the city of Clermont-Ferrand(France). The experiential results show that, on one hand the Mobi+prototype system reaches the design expectations and provides aneffective urban bus access service for people with disabilities; on theother hand the Mobi+ system is easily to deploy in the buses and at busstations thanks to its low energy consumption and small form factor. public urban transportation service access; people with disabilities;urban environmental surveillance; fault-tolerant component-basedarchitecture; resource awareness communication and scheduling</td><td>( ICT ) greentechnologies ( GT ) concepts</td><td>( ict ) greentechnologies ( gt ) concepts</td><td>( ict ) greentechnologies ( gt ) concept</td></tr>\n",

However, as the number ofcomponent-based applications in modern automotive embedded systems growsrapidly and the hardware topology becomes increasingly complex,deploying such large number of components in automotive distributedsystem in manual way is over-dependent on experience of engineers whichin turn is time consuming. Furthermore, the resource limitation andscheduling analysis make the problems more complex for developers tofind out an approximate optimal deploying approach in systemintegration. In this paper, we propose a novel method to deploy theAUTOSAR components onto ECUs with the following features. First, aclustering algorithm is designed for deploying components automaticallywithin relatively low time complexity. Second, a fitness function isdesigned to balance the ECUs load. The goal of our approach is tominimize the communication cost over all the runnable entities whilemeeting all corresponding timing constraints and balancing all the ECUsload. The experiment results show that our approach is efficient and haswell performance by comparing with other existing methods in specificand synthetic data set.

The synchronous dataflow (SDF) model isparticularly well-suited to dataflow-based graphical programming becauseits restricted semantics offer strong formal properties and significantcompile-time predictability, while capturing the behavior of a largeclass of important signal processing applications. When synthesizingsoftware for embedded signal processing applications, criticalconstraints arise due to the limited amounts of memory. In this paper,we propose a solution to the problem of jointly optimizing the code anddata size when converting SDF programs into software implementations.We consider two approaches. The first is a customization to acyclicgraphs of a bottom-up technique, called pairwise grouping of adjacentnodes (PGAN), that was proposed earlier for general SDF graphs. We showthat our customization to acyclic graphs significantly reduces thecomplexity of the general PGAN algorithm, and we present a formal studyof our modified PGAN technique that rigorously establishes itsoptimality for a certain class of applications. The second approach thatwe consider is a top-down technique, based on a generalized minimum-cutoperation, that was introduced recently in {[}14]. We present theresults of an extensive experimental investigation on the performance ofour modified PGAN technique and the top-down approach and on thetradeoffs between them. Based on these results, we conclude that thesetwo techniques complement each other, and thus, they should both beincorporated into SDF-based software implementation environments inwhich the minimization of memory requirements is important.

Areal-time contract determines the fulfillment of a component's responsetime requirements when it operates in a client-server relation withother components. This represents a typical contract testing scenario inwhich the client component needs to assess the timely response of anassociated server component according to its usage profile of thatserver.

Several pilot testsshowed that different user groups, including therapists with generalcomputer skills and adolescents with autism could make simple trainingor general behavioral scenarios within 1 h, by connecting existingbehavioral blocks and by typing textual robot commands for fine-tuningthe behaviors. In addition, this paper explains the basic conceptsbehind the TiViPE based robot control platform, and gives guidelines forchoosing the robot programming tool and designing end-user platforms forrobots.

Poor clinical outcomes are primarily causedby delayed recognition, especially due to diverse clinical diagnosticcriteria with complex manifestations, irregular episodes, and alreadyoverloaded clinical activities. With the proliferation of measuringdevices and increased computational capabilities, cyber-physicalcharacterization plays an increasingly important role in many domains toprovide enabling technologies. This paper presents a cyber-physicalsystem (CPS) framework to assist physicians in making earlier diagnosesof paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity based on existing medicalknowledge. We propose a configurable diagnostic knowledge model tocharacterize clinical criteria to reduce domain knowledge deficiencybetween physicians and computer scientists. We present a component-basedmedical CPS framework to employ the knowledge models and integratemedical devices. Our approach aims to relieve medical staff from theheavy burden of clinical activities and to provide timely decisionsupport. We evaluate our approach on 128 realworld clinical cases.Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, the results demonstratethat we enable early detection in 11.02\\% more patients and detect thecondition 16.57 hours earlier on average.

However, reliance on suchschemes may expose the network to large impacts - including blackouts -if the SPS does not respond as designed, so the deployment of SPS shouldbalance risks and benefits. This paper formulates a risk-basedcost-benefit framework that allows the operator to strike an optimalbalance between constraint costs and risks of demand curtailment due tomalfunctioning SPS. It is applied to a simple 4-bus power systeminspired by the GB network, for which an exact optimisation problem canbe formulated. A component-based dependability model is developed forthe SPS to determine its failure modes and associated probabilities. Theresulting cost-minimisation problem is solved for a range of operatingconditions and SPS reliability levels. The results consistently showcost savings from the use of an SPS, even if it is highly unreliable,when a hedging strategy may be used. The optimal solution is highlysensitive to the problem parameters, but it is demonstrated that optimaloperational strategies are associated with particular SPS outcomes. Thisfinding may be used as empirical guidance to develop operationalstrategies for complex networks with unreliable SPS. (C) 2016 TheAuthors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Because churned objects areshort-lived, they appear to be good candidates for stack allocation.Unfortunately, most churned objects escape their allocating function,making escape analysis ineffective.We reduce object churn with three contributions. First, we formalize twomeasures of churn, capture and control (15). Second, we developlightweight dynamic analyses for measuring both capture and control.Third, we develop an algorithm that uses capture and control to inlineportions of the call graph to make churned objects non-escaping,enabling churn optimization via escape analysis.JOLT is a lightweight dynamic churn optimizer that uses our algorithms.We embedded JOLT in the JIT compiler of the IBM J9 commercial JVM, andevaluated JOLT on large application frameworks, including Eclipse andJBoss. We found that JOLT eliminates over 4 times as many allocations asa state-of-the-art escape analysis alone.

A runnable virtual node is acoarse-grained software component that provides functional and temporalisolation with respect to its environment. Its interaction with theenvironment is bounded both by a functional and a temporal interface,and the validity of its internal temporal behaviour is preserved whenintegrated with other components or when reused in a new environment.Our realization of RVN exploits the latest techniques for hierarchicalscheduling to achieve temporal isolation, and the principles fromcomponent-based software-engineering to achieve functional isolation. Ituses a two-level deployment process, i.e. deploying functional entitiesto RVNs and then deploying RVNs to physical nodes, and thus also givesdevelopment benefits with respect to composability, system integration,testing, and validation. In addition, we have implemented a server-basedinter-RVN communication strategy to not only support the predictableintegration and reuse properties of RVNs by keeping the communicationcode in a separate server, but also increasing the maintainability andflexibility to change the communication code without affecting thetiming properties of RVNs. We have applied our approach to a case study,implemented in the ProCom component technology executing on top of aFreeRTOS-based hierarchical scheduling framework and present the resultsas a proof-of-concept.

Factors affectingthe software complexity of components embedded in an ECU depend not onlyon their interface and interaction properties, but also on thestructural constraints characterized by a component's functionalsemantics and timing constraints described by AUTomotive Open SystemARchitecture (AUTOSAR) languages. Traditional constraint complexitymeasures are not adequate for the components in embedded softwaresystems as they do not yet sufficiently provide a measure of thecomplexity due to timing constraints which are important for quantifyingthe dynamic behavior of components at run-time. This paper presents amethod for measuring the constraint complexity of components inautomotive embedded software systems at the specification level. Itfirst enables system designers to define non-deterministic constraintson the event chains associated with components using the AUTOSAR-basedModeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems (MARTE)-UML andTiming Augmented Description Language (TADL). Then, system analysts useUnified Modeling Language (UML)-compliant Object Constraint Language(OCL) and its Real-time extension (RT-OCL) to specify the structural andtiming constraints on events and event chains and estimate theconstraint complexity of components using a measure we have developed. Apreliminary version of the method was presented in M. Garg and R. Lai,Measuring the constraint complexity of automotive embedded softwaresystems, in Proc. Int. Conf. Data and Software Engineering, 2014, pp.1-6. To demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we have applied it toan automotive Anti-lock Brake System (ABS).

This is a challenging,time-consuming, and error-prone process requiring significantinteraction between engineers and software programmers. Furthermore, theresulting code generally lacks. modularity and robustness in thepresence of failure. Model-based programming addresses theselimitations, allowing engineers to program reactive systems byspecifying high-level control strategies and by assembling commonsensemodels of the system hardware and software. In executing a controlstrategy, model-based executives reason about the models ``on the fly,`` to track system state, diagnose faults, and perform reconfigurations.This paper develops the Reactive Model-Based Programming Language (RMPL)and its executive, called Titan. RMPL provides the features ofsynchronous, reactive languages, with the added ability of reading andwriting to state variables that are hidden within the physical plantbeing controlled. Titan executes an RMPL program using extensivecomponent-based declarative models of the plant to track states, analyzeanomalous situations, and generate novel control sequences. Within itsreactive control loop, Titan employs propositional inference to deducethe system's current and desired states, and it employs model-basedreactive planning to move the plant from the current to the desiredstate. constraint programming; model-based autonomy; model-based execution;model-based programming; model-based reasoning; robotic execution;synchronous programming</td><td>; robotic execution;synchronous programming</td><td>; robotic execution;synchronous programming</td><td>; robotic execution;synchronous program</td></tr>\n",

In this and other areas ofmanufacturing and materials handling, these legacy automationtechnologies are increasingly limiting for the growing demand forsystems that are reconfigurable, fault tolerant, and easy to maintain.IEC 61499 Function Blocks is an emerging architectural framework for thedesign of distributed industrial automation systems and their reusablecomponents. A number of architectures have been suggested for multiagentand holonic control systems that incorporate function blocks. This paperpresents a multiagent control approach for a baggage handling system(BHS) using IEC 61499 Function Blocks. In particular, it focuses ondemonstrating a decentralized control system that is scalable,reconfigurable, and fault tolerant. The design follows the automationobject approach, and produces a function block component representing asingle section of conveyor. In accordance with holonic principles, thiscomponent is autonomous and collaborative, such that the structure andthe behavior of a BHS can be entirely defined by the interconnection ofthese components within the function block design environment.Simulation is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the agent-basedcontrol system and a utility is presented for real-time viewing of thesesystems. Tests on a physical conveyor test system demonstrateddeployment to embedded control hardware.Note to Practitioners-It is well recognized that flexibility andreconfigurability of manufacturing systems pose a major challenge totheir automation. There is also a belief among automation researchersthat decentralized intelligent control will contribute significantly tothe flexibility of manufacturing systems. Achievements in practicalapplications using decentralized control have been limited by thestanding tradition of automation design with centralized logic executedon programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The new programmingarchitecture defined by IEC 61499 is specifically designed fordistributed applications and invalidates many existing assumptions aboutthe difficulty of implementing these systems using partially or fullydecentralized execution.In this paper, we present results of developing a distributed automationarchitecture based on IEC 61499 for airport baggage handling systems.Such systems are constantly undergoing reconfiguration, repair andexpansion so flexibility is a vital design metric. We demonstrateseveral sides of ``flexibility{''} enabled by IEC 61499, includingcomponent reuse, maintenance and human interaction, and reconfiguration.

In such resource-poor platforms, the ability to efficientlydelimit and reconfigure the necessary portion of sensor software-insteadof updating the full binary image-is of vital importance. However, mostexisting approaches in this field have not been adopted widely to datedue to the extensive use of WSN resources or lack of generality. In thisarticle, we therefore consider WSN programming models and runtimereconfiguration models as two interrelated factors and we present anintegrated approach for addressing efficient reprogramming in WSNs. Themiddleware solution we propose, REMOWARE, is characterized by mitigatingthe cost of post-deployment software updates on sensor nodes via thenotion of in situ reconfigurability and providing a component-basedprogramming abstraction in order to facilitate the development ofdynamic WSN applications. Our evaluation results show that REMOWAREimposes a very low energy overhead in code distribution and componentreconfiguration and consumes approximately 6\\% of the total code memoryon a TELOSB sensor platform.

Toovercome this problem, we propose a new component-based modeling andverification method for adaptive embedded systems. The component-basedmodeling approach facilitates abstracting a composition of components toa hierarchical component. In the hierarchical component, the number ofpossible configurations of the composition is reduced to a small numberof hierarchical configurations. Only these hierarchical configurationshave to be considered when the hierarchical component is used in furthercompositions such that design complexity is reduced at each hierarchicallevel.

With this increasing complexity of the system design, ithas become very critical to enhance system design productivity to meetthe time-to-market demands and reduce product development cost.Real-time embedded system designers are facing extreme challenges in theunderlying architectural design selection. This involves the selectionof a programmable, concurrent, heterogeneous multiprocessor architectureplatform. Such a multiprocessor-system-on-chip platform has setinnovative trends for the real-time systems and system-on-chipdesigners. The consequences of this trend imply a shift in concern fromcomputation and sequential algorithms to modeling concurrency,synchronization, and communication in every aspect of hardware andsoftware co-design and development. Therefore, there is a need for ahigh level methodology that can provide a complete system modeling andarchitecture/component selection platform. The proposed six-step systemmodeling methodology provides a process for performance driven componentselection, to avoid costly iterative system design re-spins, therebyenhancing system design productivity. We demonstrate our methodology byapplying it onto a network-on-chip architecture for selecting itscomponents given certain system specification and system-levelperformance requirements.

Currently, many approaches are proposed to aid the developmentand evaluation of secure components. However, it is well known amongpractitioners that, like any other software entities, components cannotbe completely secure. This fact leads us to incorporate intrusiondetection facilities to equip components with mechanisms to discoverintrusions against components. In this paper, we present a framework fordeveloping components with intrusion detection capabilities. Thisframework uses UMLintr, a UML profile for intrusion specifications. Theprofile allows developers to specify intrusion scenarios using UMLdiagrams. Specifying intrusion scenarios using the same language that isused for specifying software behavior eliminates the need for separatelanguages for describing intrusions. Other software specificationlanguages can be easily adopted into this framework. The outcome of thisframework are components equipped with intrusion detectors. Based onUMLintr, a prototype is built and used to generate signatures for someintrusions included in the benchmark DARPA attack datasets. Furthermore,we describe an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which uses thesesignatures to detect component intrusions.

DSL may be embedded in host languages like Python orC++.

A run-time monitor isembedded in the server for such applications, in order to detecterroneous conditions, and perform appropriate reactions in a timelymanner. However, modification of the monitor may require stop andrestart of the server, in order to take effect. This kind of option isnot permissible where the server should be performing continuously.

This paper proposes a systemic method for the constructionof verification model. PLC system architecture and PLC features aremodeled as components. This is universal for all PLC applications.

The viewpoint of the use case modelthat views a system as a black box focuses on descriptions of externalinteractions between the system and related environments. However, forembedded systems that do not disclose most implementation logics outsidethe system, black box-based use case models may experience the drawbackthat considerable information that must be defined for systemdevelopments is omitted. To solve this shortcoming, several studies havebeen proposed on the use of kind of white box technique in which thedynamic behaviors of embedded systems are defined first using a statediagram and the results are reflected in the requirement specifications.However, white box-based modeling has not been widely adopted bydevelopers due to tasks that require a lot of time in the requirementanalysis phase in the initial phase of the software development lifecycle. This study proposes a gray box-based requirement specificationmethod as a trade-off between two contradictory elements (the amount ofinformation required to develop an embedded system and the cost of theeffort required during the requirement analysis phase) in terms of thetwo approaches, the black and the white box-based models. The proposedmethod suggests that an appropriate depth level of embedded systemmodeling is required to define the requirements. This study alsoproposes a mechanism that automatically generates an applicationprogramming interface for each component based on the created model. Theproposed method was applied to the development of a camera sensorcontroller in a mobile phone, and the case results proved thefeasibility of the method through discussion of the application results. embedded system; automatic requirement specifications; state model;camera sensor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & embedded system  & embedded system  & embedded system\\\\\n",

In this way it ispossible to investigate the effects of power converter faults inelectrical drives with the aim to propose solutions that allow to reducethe periods of drives inoperability. In this paper, a suitablerealization of a test bench combining an embedded system based on a FPGAboard with a high-level graphical programming language is proposed toreplace part of the electrical drive hardware. Differently than standardapproaches for FPGA programming, which are normally based on hardwaredescription languages, the proposed solution exploits an environmentsoftware platform with a high level of abstraction that leads to a goodtrade-off between accuracy and hardware resources, also allowing afaster prototyping procedure. The proposed HIL solution has been used tostudy some common faults occurring in power converters, evaluating thebehavior of a standard drive operating with different controlalgorithms.

The typical specialization process is based on a mixof precompiler macros and build scripts, both of which are known forbeing sources of errors.In this article, we present a new model-based approach to the design ofapplication-specific RTOS. Starting with finite state models describingthe RTOS and the application requirements, the set of blocks in the RTOScode actually used by the application is automatically computed. Thisset is used to build an application-specific RTOS model. This model isfed into a code generator to produce the source code of anapplication-specific RTOS. It is also used to carry on model-basedvalidations and verifications, including the formal verification thatthe specialization process did not introduce unwanted behaviors orsuppress expected ones.To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, it is applied tospecialize Trampoline, an open-source implementation of the AUTOSAR OSstandard, to an industrial case study from the automotive domain.

However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication. We present an algorithm that transforms component-baseddesign spaces, expressible in CoDeL, to an SMT program, which, solved bystate-of-the-art SMT solvers, determines the satisfiability of thesynthesis problem, and delivers a correct-by-construction systemconfiguration. Evaluation results for use cases in the domain ofscheduling and mapping of distributed real-time processes confirm,first, the performance gain of SMT compared to traditional design spaceexploration approaches, second, the usability gains by expressing designproblems in CoDeL, and third, the capability of the CoDeL/SMT approachto support the design of embedded systems.

       "\t Automatic synthesis of communication and concurrency for exploringcomponent-based system implementations considering UML channel semantics & 10.1016/j.sysarc.2015.07.002 & 2015 & Automatic synthesis of communication and concurrency for exploringcomponent-based system implementations considering UML channel semantics Nowadays, multi-processor systems play a critical role in embeddedsystem engineering. As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess. To demonstrate these capabilities, the methodology is testedwith two large examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While technologyexists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-basedapplications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools.Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very fewexisting and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution todevelopers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integratedmodel-driven development environment that addresses all phases ofapplication lifecycle including design, development, verification,analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, withsupporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such amodel-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, thispaper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMSML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specificsub-languages. We claim that the language promotes``correct-by-construction\\{''\\} software development and integration bysupporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle. Using acase study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS ML impacts thedevelopment of embedded systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in \\{{[}\\}1{]}). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself. We first present a performance analysis ofdifferent JIT compilation technologies in order to identify hardware andsoftware optimization opportunities. Second, we propose a solution basedon a dedicated processor with specialized instructions for criticalfunctions of JIT compilers. These specialized instructions provide anaverage 5x speedup on manipulations of associative arrays and dynamicmemory allocation. Based on the LLVM framework, we show a 15\\textbackslash{}\\% overallspeedup on code generator's execution time. Because our specializedinstructions are hidden behind standard libraries, we also argue thatthese instructions may be transparently reused for a wider range ofapplications.

These components need to interact in atimely fashion to achieve the system level end-to-end requirements. Inpractice, the component level timing specification consists of designattributes like component task mapping, task period and scheduledefinition but often lack details on their real-time (functional)requirements. As we observe, there is no systematic methodology in placefor decomposing the feature level timing requirements into componentlevel timing requirements. This paper proposes an early stagetime-budgeting methodology to bridge the above gap. A salient proposalof this methodology is to consider parameterized componenttiming-requirements. A key step in the methodology involves computing aset of constraints by relating component requirements with featurerequirements. This enables the separation of timing constraints fromfunctionality decomposition, and facilitates early optimization of thecomponent time-budget for a complex component based embedded system.This paper formalizes the proposed methodology by using ParametricTemporal Logic. A case study involving two advanced features from theautomotive domain, namely Adaptive Cruise Control and CollisionMitigation is given to demonstrate the methodology.

The control software adapts several control variables tokeep the operational state optimal with respect to multiple objectives.There exist well-known techniques for solving such optimizationproblems. However, current practice shows that the applied techniques,control variables, constraints and related design decisions are notdocumented as a part of the architecture description. Theirimplementation is implicit, tailored for specific characteristics of theembedded system, tightly integrated into and coupled with the controlsoftware, which hinders its reusability, analyzability andmaintainability. This paper presents an architectural framework todesign, document and realize multi-objective optimization in embeddedcontrol software. The framework comprises an architectural styletogether with its visual editor and domain-specific analysis tools, anda code generator. The code generator generates an optimizer modulespecific for the given architecture and it employs aspect-orientedsoftware development techniques to seamlessly integrate this module intothe control software. The effectiveness of the framework is validated inthe context of an industrial case study from the printing systemsdomain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methodsand tools are needed to assist the architect during system design.The goal of this paper is to show how metaheuristic optimizationapproaches can improve the process of designing efficient architecturesfor a set of given quality attributes. A case study is conducted inwhich an architecture optimization framework is applied to an existingsub-system in the automotive industry. The case study shows thatmetaheuristic optimization approaches can find efficient solutions forall quality attributes while fulfilling given constraints.By optimizing multiple quality attributes the framework proposesrevolutionary architecture solutions in contrast to human architects,who tend to propose solutions based on previous architectures. Althoughthe case study shows savings in manual effort, it also shows that theproposed architecture solutions should be assessed by the humanarchitect.

Such a system isdataflow (for its description) and time triggered (for its execution).The architecture forms a graph of communicating components, where morethan one path can link two components. Because the characteristics ofthe network and the behavior of intermediate components may vary or areonly partially known, these paths often have different timingcharacteristics, and the flows of information that transit on thesepaths reach their destination at independent times. However, anapplication that seeks consistent values will require these flows to betemporally matched so that a component uses inputs that all (directly orindirectly) depend on the same computation step of another component. Inthis paper, we define this temporal data-matching property, both in astrict sense and in a relaxed way allowing approximately consistentvalues. Then, we show how to analyze a system architecture to detectsituations that result in data-matching inconsistencies. In the contextof multiperiodic systems, where components do not necessarily share acommon period, we also describe an approach to manage data matching thatuses queues to delay too fast paths and timestamps to recognizeconsistent data sets.

       "\t Flex-eWare: a flexible model driven solution for designing andimplementing embedded distributed systems                                    & 10.1002/spe.1143             & 2012 & Flex-eWare: a flexible model driven solution for designing andimplementing embedded distributed systems The complexity of modern embedded systems increases as they incorporatenew concerns such as distribution and mobility. These new features needto be considered as early as possible in the software development lifecycle. Model driven engineering promotes an intensive use of models andis now widely seen as a solution to master the development of complexsystems such as embedded ones. Component-based software engineering isanother major trend that gains acceptance in the embedded world becauseof its properties such as reuse, modularity, and flexibility. Thisarticle proposes the Flex-eWare component model (FCM) for designing andimplementing modern embedded systems. The FCM unifies model drivenengineering and component-based software engineering and has beenevaluated in several application domains with different requirements:wireless sensor networks, distributed client/server applications, andcontrol systems for electrical devices. This approach highlights a newconcept: flexibility points that arise at several stages of thedevelopment process, that is, in the model (design phase), in theexecution platform, and during the execution itself. This flexibilitypoints are captured with model libraries that can extend the FCM.Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \\textbackslash{}\\& Sons, Ltd. embedded system; software component; flexibility; model drivenengineering                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & embedded system  & embedded system  & embedded system\\\\\n",

Asthey integrate hard- and software elements, their functionality andreliability are often tested by hardware-in-the-loop methods, in whichthe system under test runs in a simulated environment. Due to the risingcomplexity of the embedded functions, performance limitations andpracticability reasons, the simulations are often specialized to testspecific aspects of the embedded system and develop a high diversity bythemselves. This diversity is difficult to manage for a user and resultsin erroneously selected test components and compatibility problems inthe test configuration. This paper presents a generative programmingapproach that handles the diversity of test libraries. Compatibilityissues are explicitly evaluated by a new interface concept.

In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules. This yields an effective and cost-efficient approach tocompositional synchronous modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployedRemora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligibleCPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. wireless sensor networks; high-level programming; component model;event-driven                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

We define an architecture ofreconfigurable multiagent systems, where a reconfiguration agent modeledby nested state machines is affected to each device of the executionenvironment to apply local automatic reconfigurations, and acoordination agent is proposed for any coordination between devices inorder to guarantee safe and adequate distributed reconfigurations. Acommunication protocol is proposed in our research to handlecoordinations between agents by using well-defined coordinationmatrices.

To alleviate the burden on students in the roboticscurriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform onembedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has beendeveloped and fabricated as a supplement for these students. Thisgeneral-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial trainingkits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has beenbrought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and C/OS-II suchthat it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition tolinking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, userscan program the codes not only in C language, but also through visualprogramming by means of a graphic interface developed along with theplatform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot functiondesign. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping inrobotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated withthe platform has been designed and used in classes. Based on assessmentsand evaluation on the students who have completed this course, thecurricular training is satisfactory and largely meets the requirementsestablished at the design stage.

Nowadays, limited relatedworks have been proposed to address particular cases of reconfigurationswithout considering distributed architectures. Our first problem is tobe able to handle all possible forms of reconfigurations that can beapplied at run-time to distributed Function Blocks. In this case, acoordination between devices of the execution environment should beapplied to guarantee safe and coherent distributed reconfigurations. Asecond problem is to find the sufficient solutions for the correctimplementation of this reconfigurable distributed architecture.Objective: The paper defines an implementable multi-agent architecturefor automatic and coherent reconfigurations of distributed FunctionBlocks.Method: To address all possible industrial forms, we classify thereconfiguration scenarios into three levels. The first level deals withadditions-removals of Function Blocks to-from the system'simplementation. The second deals with updates of compositions of blocks,and the third deals with updates of data. We define a ReconfigurationAgent for each device of the execution environment, and a uniqueCoordination Agent for coordinations between devices. EachReconfiguration Agent to be modelled by nested state machines applieslocal reconfiguration scenarios in the corresponding device aftercoordinations with the Coordination Agent. We propose an Inter-AgentsCommunication Protocol to support correct and coherent reconfigurationsof distributed devices. This protocol is based on Coordination Matricesto be handled by the Coordination Agent in order to define allreconfiguration scenarios that should be simultaneously applied indistributed devices. We propose XML-based implementations for both kindsof agents where XML code blocks are exchanged between devices toguarantee safety distributed reconfigurations. The contributions of thepaper are applied to two Benchmark Production Systems available in ourresearch laboratory.Results: The communication protocol is successfully applied to ourplatforms where simulations are executed to check distributed andcoherent reconfiguration scenarios. The Reconfiguration and CoordinationAgents are implemented in this platform by following the InternationalStandard IEC61499. We show in addition XML-based successful interactionsbetween devices when distributed reconfigurations are applied.Conclusion: The paper successfully defines a multi-agent architecturefor IEC61499 distributed reconfigurable embedded systems whereCoordination and Reconfiguration agents are proposed to allow feasibleand coherent distributed reconfigurations by using a definedcommunication protocol. This architecture is implemented in XML andapplied to real industrial platforms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Although there havebeen pioneering efforts in applying componentization tosystems-building, these efforts have tended to target specificapplication domains (e. g., embedded systems, operating systems,communications systems, programmable networking environments, ormiddleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantageof this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity andabstraction potential of the component approach. In this article, weargue for the benefits and feasibility of a generic yet tailorableapproach to component-based systems-building that offers a uniformprogramming model that is applicable in a wide range of systems-orientedtarget domains and deployment environments. The component model, calledOpenCom, is supported by a reflective runtime architecture that isitself built from components. After describing OpenCom and evaluatingits performance and overhead characteristics, we present and evaluatetwo case studies of systems we have built using OpenCom technology, thusillustrating its benefits and its general applicability. design; standardization; management; component-based software; computersystems implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

Embeddedsystems are pervasive and often mission-critical, therefore, they mustbe highly trustworthy. Trustworthy embedded systems require extensiveverification. The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions ofbottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verificationcomplexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verificationreuse. Case studies on a suite of networked sensors have shown that ourapproach facilitates major verification reuse and leads toorder-of-magnitude reduction on verification complexity.

At the same time,microkernel-based operating systems are being used to increase thereliability and trustworthiness of embedded systems. Since themicrokernel approach to designing systems is partially based on thecomponentisation of system services, component-based softwareengineering is a particularly attractive approach to developingmicrokernel-based systems. While a number of widely used componentarchitectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprisecomputing rather than embedded systems. Due to the uniquecharacteristics of embedded systems, a component architecture forembedded systems must have low overhead, be able to address relevantnon-functional issues, and be flexible to accommodate applicationspecific requirements. In this paper we introduce a componentarchitecture aimed at the development of microkernel-based embeddedsystems. The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible. We have implemented a prototype of this architecture andconfirm that it has very low overhead and is suitable for implementingboth system-level and application level services.

At the same time, the systemsmust fulfill strict requirements on reliability and correctness.This paper proposes a formal verification methodology which smoothlyintegrates with component-based system-level design using a divide andconquer approach. The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component. Themethodology verifies the correctness of the glue logic inserted betweenthe components and the interaction of the components through the gluelogic. Each such glue logic is verified one at a time using modelchecking techniques.Experimental results have shown the efficiency of the proposedmethodology and demonstrated that it is feasible to apply such averification methodology on real-life examples. formal verification; petri-nets; components; iP; model checking;embedded systems; real-time systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & Embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

Developers want to maximizethe use of the limited resources available on the device while still notexceeding the capabilities of the device. To do this, the developer mustbe able to scale his software for different platforms. In this paper, wepresent a software engineering methodology that automatically scalessoftware to different platforms. We intend to have the applicationdeveloper write high level functional specifications of his software andhave tools that automatically scale the underlying runtime. These toolswill use the functional and non-functional constraints of both thehardware and client application to produce an appropriate runtime. Ourinitial results show that the proposed approach can scale operatingsystems and virtual machines that satisfy the constraints of varyinghardware/application combinations. design; performance; languages; embedded systems; runtime systems;components; constraints; wireless sensor networks; generativeprogramming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

Component middleware,however, also introduces challenges for DRE system developers, such asevaluating the predictability of DRE system behavior, and choosing theright design alternatives before committing to a specific platform orplatform configuration. Model-based technologies help address theseissues by enabling design-time analysis, and providing the means toautomate the development, deployment, configuration, and integration ofcomponent-based DRE systems. To this end, this paper applies modelchecking techniques to DRE design models using model transformations toverify key QoS properties of component-based DRE systems developed usingReal-time CORBA. We introduce a formal semantic domain for a generalclass of DRE systems that enables the verification of distributednon-preemptive real-time scheduling. Our results show that model-basedtechniques enable design-time analysis of timed properties and can beapplied to effectively predict, simulate, and verify the event-drivenbehavior of component-based DRE systems. schedulability analysis; model checking; component middleware;distributed real-time; embedded systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints. We use amulti-objective concept to model the composition analysis problem anduse an evolutionary algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal solutionsefficiently. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem. We bring forth anumber of issues related to the automation of reusable IP compositionincluding type- compatibility checking, split-programming, andintrospective composition environment, and demonstrate their utilitythrough design examples. hardware/software co-design; system-on-chip; embedded systems; hardwaredescription language (HDL); modeling; simulation; design reuse;interface design                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

My aim is to provide an efficient,lightweight code generation scheme suitable for resource constrainedmicrocontrollers.I describe an initial implementation of SCOPE-a hierarchical codegenerator for a variant of the statechart language. I shall discussseveral techniques implemented in the tool, namely imposing andexploiting a regular hierarchy structure, labeling schemes for fastancestor queries, improvements in exiting states, compile-time scoperesolution for transitions, and various details of compact runtimerepresentation.The resulting algorithm avoids the exponential code growth exhibited bytools based on flattening of hierarchical state machine. At the sametime it demonstrates that it is possible to maintain reasonable speedand size results even for small models, while preserving the hierarchyat runtime. SCOPE currently produces code that is comparable with thatof industrial tools (IAR visualSTATE) for small models and clearly winsfor bigger ones. algorithms; performance; program synthesis; automatic code generation;statecharts; embedded systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

This paper argues thatmodeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyzeinteractions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a morestructured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity,to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semanticframework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses theissues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desirefor component reuse. It introduces the notion of domain polymorphism asa way to address these issues. component-based design; embedded systems; heterogeneous modeling; modelsof computation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & embedded systems & embedded systems & embedded system\\\\\n",

To obtain a low-cost and portablesolution for implementing the DTCWT in multi-channel real-timeapplications, various embedded-system approaches are realised. Forcomparison, the DTCWT was implemented in C language on a personalcomputer and on a PIC microcontroller. However, in the former approachportability and in the latter desired speed performance propertiescannot be achieved. Hence, implementation of the DTCWT on areconfigurable platform such as field programmable gate array, whichprovides portable, low-cost, low-power, and high-performance computing,is considered as the most feasible solution. At first, they used thesystem generator DSP design tool of Xilinx for algorithm design.However, the design implemented by using such tools is not optimised interms of area and power. To overcome all these drawbacks mentionedabove, they implemented the DTCWT algorithm by using Verilog HardwareDescription Language, which has its own difficulties. To overcome thesedifficulties, simplify the usage of proposed algorithms and theadaptation procedures, a code generator program that can producedifferent architectures is proposed.

In this way, properties that can only beroughly estimated statically are evaluated against observed values andthis consequently allows to refine the design models for ensuringpreservation of analysed extra-functional properties at code level.Method: Following the model-driven engineering vision, (meta-) modelsand transformations are used as main artefacts for the realisation ofthe round-trip support which is finally validated against an industrialcase study.Result: This article presents an approach to support the wholeround-trip process starting from the generation of source code for atarget platform, passing through the monitoring of selected systemquality attributes at code level, and finishing with theback-propagation of observed values to modelling level. The technique isvalidated against an industrial case study in the telecommunicationsapplicative domain.Conclusion: Preservation of extra-functional properties throughappropriate description, computation and evaluation makes it possible toreduce final product verification and validation effort and costs bygenerating correct-by-construction code. The proposed round-trip supportaids a model-driven component-based development process in ensuring adesired level of extra-functional properties preservation from thesource modelling artefacts to the generated code.

The current implementation targets problem families that can betransformed, using disciplined convex programming techniques, to convexquadratic programs of modest size. CVXGEN generates simple, flat,library-free code suitable for embedding in real-time applications. Thegenerated code is almost branch free, and so has highly predictablerun-time behavior. The combination of regularization (both static anddynamic) and iterative refinement in the search direction computationyields reliable performance, even with poor quality data. In this paperwe describe how CVXGEN is implemented, and give some results on thespeed and reliability of the automatically generated solvers.

SR models allowto formally verify the correctness of the design and automaticallygenerate the implementation code. This feature is a major productivityenhancement and, more importantly, can ensure correct-by-design softwareprovided that the code generator is provably correct. This paperpresents an improvement of code generation technology for SR obtainedvia a novel algorithm for optimizing the multitask implementation ofSimulink models on single-processor platforms with limited availabilityof memory. Existing code generation tools require the addition ofzero-order hold (ZOH) blocks, and therefore additional memory, andpossibly also additional functional delays whenever there is a ratetransition in the computation and communication flow. Our algorithmleverages a novel efficient encoding of the scheduling feasibilityregion to find the task implementation of function blocks with minimumadditional functional delays within timing and memory constraints. Thealgorithm is applied to an automotive case study with tens of functionblocks and very high utilization to test its applicability to complexsystems.

Wedescribe an implemented technique for producing optimizing compilers forDSELs, based on Kamin's idea of DSELs for program generation. Thetechnique uses a data type of syntax for basic types, a set of smartconstructors that perform rewriting over those types, some code motiontransformations, and a back-end code generator. Domain-specificoptimization results from chains of domain-independent rewrites on basictypes. New DSELs are defined directly in terms of the basic syntactictypes, plus host language functions and tuples. This definition stylemakes compilers easy to write and, in fact, almost identical to thesimplest embedded interpreters.

Unfortunately however, thereported level of adoption has been comparatively low. Where successeswere had, they were largely facilitated by the manifest endorsement,where not the mandate, by relevant stakeholders, either internal to theindustrial adopter or with authority over the application domain. Thework presented in this paper stems from a comprehensive initiative takenby the European Space Agency (ESA) and its industrial suppliers. Thisinitiative also enjoyed significant synergy with interests shown forsimilar goals by the telecommunications and railways domain, thanks tothe interaction between two parallel project frameworks. The ESA effortaimed at favouring the adoption of a software reference architectureacross its software supply chain. The center of that strategy revolvesaround a component model and the software development process thatbuilds on it.

The methodology relies on RT-CCM (Real-timeContainer Component Model), a component technology aimed to make thetiming behaviour of the applications predictable and inspired in theLightweight CCM specification of the OMG. Some new mechanisms have beenintroduced in the underlying framework that make it possible to schedulethe execution of code and the transmission of messages of an applicationwhile guaranteeing that the application will meet its timingrequirements when executed. The added mechanisms also enable theapplication designer to configure this scheduling without interferingwith the opacity typically required in component management. Moreover,the methodology includes a process for generating the real-time model ofa component-based application as a composition of the reusable real-timemodels of the components that form it. From the analysis of this modelthe application designer obtains the configuration values that must beapplied to the component instances and the elements of the framework inorder to make the application fulfil its timing requirements.

They are ubiquitous intoday's technological landscape and found in domains such astelecommunications, nuclear power, avionics, and medical technology.These systems are difficult to design and build because they mustsatisfy both functional and timing requirements to work correctly intheir intended environment. Furthermore, embedded systems are oftencritical systems, where failure can lead to loss of life, loss ofmission, or serious financial consequences. Because of the difficulty increating these systems and the consequences of failure, they requirerigorous and reliable design approaches. The synchronous approach is onepossible answer to this demand. Its mathematical basis provides formalconcepts that favor the trusted design of embedded real-time systems.The multiclock or polychronous model stands out from other synchronousspecification models by its capability to enable the design of systemswhere each component holds its own activation clock as well assingle-clocked systems in a uniform way. A great advantage is itsconvenience for component-based design approaches that enable modulardevelopment of increasingly complex modern systems. The expressivenessof its underlying semantics allows dealing with several issues ofreal-time design.

TURTLE relies on UML's extensibility mechanisms to enhanceclass and activity diagrams. Class diagrams are extended withspecialized classes named Tclasses, which communicate and synchronizethrough gates. Also, associations between Tclasses are attributed by acomposition operator (Parallel, Synchro, Invocation, Sequence, orPreemption) which provides them with a formal semantics. TURTLE extendsUML activity diagrams with synchronization actions and temporaloperators ( deterministic delay, nondeterministic delay, time-limitedoffer, and time-capture). The real-time dimension of TURTLE has beenfurther improved by the addition of two composition operators, Periodicand Suspend, as well as suspendable delay, latency, and time-limitedoffer operators at the activity diagram level. Core characteristics ofTURLE are supported by TTool-the TURTLE toolkit-which includes a diagrameditor, a RT-LOTOS code generator and a result analyzer. The toolkitreuses RTL, a RT-LOTOS validation tool offering debug-orientedsimulation and exhaustive analysis. TTool hides RT-LOTOS to the end-userand allows him/her to directly check TURTLE modeling against logicalerrors and timing inconsistencies. Besides the foundations of the TURTLEprofile, this paper also discusses its application in the context ofspace-based embedded software. real-time systems; UML; RT-LOTOS; formal validation                                                                                                                                             & real-time systems & real-time systems & real-time system\\\\\n",

Manyrange-based localization algorithms have been proposed for 2-D sensornetworks or densely deployed 3-D sensor networks. However, range-basedlocalization in sparse 3-D sensor networks is still a challengingproblem, because the sparseness of the network makes it difficult toobtain a proper order of nodes to be sequentially localized. Thepatch-and-stitching localization strategy can conquer the sparsenessproblem in 2-D networks, but for 3-D networks it is still unknown how touniquely merge two patches when there are not enough common nodes. Inthis paper, we solve this challenging problem by deriving the conditionsunder which two subnetworks can be uniquely merged. In the proposedapproach, we treat the translation parameters as unknowns and form a setof equations with which the unknowns can be uniquely solved. The noveltyof our algorithm also lies in that we exploit both common nodes andconnecting edges among adjacent subnetworks to merge them, resulting invery high chances that two subnetworks can be merged. We conductextensive simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of theproposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm couldlocalize more than 90\\textbackslash{}\\% of nodes in sparse 3-D networks with averagenode degree of 11 and anchor ratio of 5\\textbackslash{}\\%, while the best existingsolution can localize only 52\\textbackslash{}\\% of nodes in the same situation.

PROVIZ is an integrated visualization and programming frameworkwith the following features: PROVIZ includes (1) a visualization toolthat can visualize heterogeneous WSN traffic (with different packetpayload formats) by parsing the data received either from a packetsniffer (e.g., a sensor-based sniffer or a commercial TI SmartRF802.15.4 packet sniffer) or from a simulator (e.g., OMNeT); (2) ascripting language based on the TinyOS sensor network platform that aimsat reducing code size and improving programming efficacy; (3) anover-the-air programming tool to securely program sensor nodes; (4) avisual programming tool with basic sensor drag-and-drop modules forgenerating simple WSN programs; and (5) a visual network comparison toolthat analyzes packet traces of two networks to generate a juxtaposedvisual comparison of contrasting network characteristics. PROVIZ alsoincludes built-in extensible visual demo deployment capabilities thatallow users to quickly craft network scenarios and share them with otherusers. In this work, we introduce the various features of PROVIZ'svisualization and programming framework, analyze test scenarios, anddiscuss how all the tools can be used in sync with each other to createan all-encompassing development and test environment.

In recent years,range-free localization algorithms have drawn much research attentiondue to their low cost and applicability to large-scale WSNs. However,the application of range-free localization algorithms is restrictedbecause of their dramatic accuracy degradation in practical anisotropicWSNs, which is mainly caused by large error of distance estimation.Distance estimation in the existing range-free algorithms usually relieson a unified per hop length (PHL) metric between nodes. But the PHLbetween different nodes might be greatly different in anisotropic WSNs,resulting in large error in distance estimation. We find that, althoughthe PHL between different nodes might be greatly different, it exhibitssignificant locality; that is, nearby nodes share a similar PHL toanchors that know their positions in advance. Based on the locality ofthe PHL, a novel distance estimation approach is proposed in thisarticle. Theoretical analyses show that the error of distance estimationin the proposed approach is only one-fourth of that in thestate-of-the-art pattern-driven scheme (PDS). An anchor selectionalgorithm is also devised to further improve localization accuracy bymitigating the negative effects from the anchors that are poorlydistributed in geometry. By combining the locality-based distanceestimation and the anchor selection, a range-free localization algorithmnamed Selective Multilateration (SM) is proposed. Simulation resultsdemonstrate that SM achieves localization accuracy higher than 0.3r,where r is the communication radius of nodes. Compared to thestate-of-the-art solution, SM improves the distance estimation accuracyby up to 57\\textbackslash{}\\% and improves localization accuracy by up to 52\\textbackslash{}\\%consequently.

Although manylocalization algorithms have been proposed in recent years, they usuallytarget at dense networks and perform poorly in sparse networks. In thispaper, we propose two component-based localization algorithms that canlocalize many more nodes in sparse networks than the state-of-the-artsolution. We first develop the Basic Common nodes-based LocalizationAlgorithm, namely BCLA, which uses both common nodes and measureddistances between adjacent components to merge components. BCLAoutperforms CALL, the state-of-the-art component-based localizationalgorithm that uses only distance measurements to merge components. Inorder to further improve the performance of BCLA, we further exploit theangular information among nodes to merge components, and propose theComponent-based Localization with Angle and Distance informationalgorithm, namely CLAD. We prove the merging conditions for BCLA andCLAD, and evaluate their performance through extensive simulations.Simulations results show that, CLAD can locate more than 90 percent ofnodes in a sparse network with average node degree 7.5, while CALL canlocate only 78 percent of nodes in the same scenario.

However, the dynamic profiling must be able toaccurately capture application behavior without incurring significantruntime overheads. Since application-and sensor-specific constraintsdictate the profiling requirements and tolerated overheads, designersrequire design assistance to quickly evaluate and select appropriateprofiling methodologies. To increase designer productivity, we formulateprofiling methodology design guidelines based on extensive evaluationand analysis of a variety of profiling methodologies suitable fordynamically monitoring WSNs with respect to network traffic overhead,power, and code impacts associated with each method. While energyconsumption increases are reasonable, ranging from 0.5\\textbackslash{}\\% to 2.6\\textbackslash{}\\%,network traffic, code size, and computation time overheads can be ashigh as 66.2\\textbackslash{}\\%, 75.9\\textbackslash{}\\%, and 136.6\\textbackslash{}\\%, respectively.

To facilitate rapid development of these profilingmethodologies, we present a profiler-customization methodologyconsisting of a code generator module, overhead estimation module, andprofile data management module. Using our profiling-customizationmethodology, designers can rapidly evaluate the overhead of differentprofiling methodologies, and automatically integrate the mostappropriate methodology into the application at design time.

Standard design and development techniques often fail toeffectively manage the complexity and dynamics of such systems. As aresult, there is a strong need for new programing models andabstractions. Towards this, component-based design methods are apromising solution. However, existing such approaches either do notaccurately model transitory interactions between components - which aretypical of cyber-physical systems - or do not provide guarantees forreal-time behavior which is essential in safety-critical applications.To overcome this problem, we present a component-based design techniquebased on DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components). The DEECoframework allows modeling large-scale dynamic systems by a set ofinteracting components and, in contrast to approaches from theliterature, it provides mechanisms to describe transitory interactionsbetween them. To allow reasoning about timing behavior at thecomponent-description level, we characterize DEECo's closed-loop delayin the worst case, i.e., the maximum time needed to react to a change inthe environment. Based on this, we incorporate real-time analysis intoDEECo's design flow. This further allows us to analyze the system'srobustness under unreliable communication and to design decentralizedsafety-preserving mechanisms. To illustrate the simplicity andusefulness of our approach, we present a case study consisting of anintelligent crossroad system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

This paper presents SBIP, an extension of BIP for stochasticsystems. SBIP offers the possibility to add stochastic information toatomic component's behaviors, and hence to the entire system. Atomiccomponent's semantics in SBIP is described by Markov Chains.

However, many applications-particularlyembedded systems-consist of not only software, but also hardwarecomponents. Thus, component-based design should be extended to systemswith both hardware and software components.Such an extension is not without challenges though. The extendedmethodology has to consider hard constraints on performance as well asdifferent cost factors. Also, the dissimilarities between hardware andsoftware (such as level of abstraction, communication primitives, etc.)have to be resolved.In this paper, the authors propose such an extended component-baseddesign methodology to include hardware components as well. Thismethodology allows the designer to work at a very high level ofabstraction, where the focus is on functionality only. Non-functionalconstraints are specified in a declarative manner, and the mapping ofcomponents to hardware or software is determined automatically based onthose constraints in the so-called hardware/software partitioning step.Moreover, a tool is presented supporting the new design methodology.Beside automating the partitioning process, this tool also checks theconsistency between hardware and software implementations of acomponent. component-based design; hardware/software co-design; hardware/softwarepartitioning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & component-based design & component-based design & component-based design\\\\\n",

Such a multi-mode system can change its behavior by switchingbetween modes under certain circumstances. Another approach tosimplifying software development is Component-Based SoftwareEngineering, which allows a system to be developed by reusablecomponents. Combining both approaches, we get component-baseddevelopment of multi-mode systems, for which a key issue is the modeswitch handling. Since most existing mode switch techniques do notconsider component-based systems, we present in this article anapproach-the Mode Switch Logic (MSL)-for the development ofcomponent-based multi-mode systems.

In addition, theemergence of new software technologies has required these applicationsto meet the needs of heterogeneous software platforms. However, theexisting approaches to build fault-tolerant systems are often targetedat a particular platform and software technology. The objective of thispaper is to discuss the use of FlexFT-a generic component-basedframework for the construction of adaptive fault-tolerant systems thatcan integrate and reuse technologies and deploy them acrossheterogeneous devices. Furthermore, FlexFT provides a standardized andinteroperable interface for sensor observations by relying upon the``Sensor Web\\{''\\} paradigm established by the Open Geospatial Consortium(OGC). We have implemented a Java prototype of our framework andevaluated the potential benefits by carrying out case studies andperformance measurements. By implementing and deploying these casestudies in standard PCs as well as in sensor nodes, we show that FlexFTcan cope with the problem of a wide degree of heterogeneity with minimalresource overheads.

Component-based software engineering proved to be a promisingsolution for managing software complexity and allowing for reuse.However, there are several challenges inherent in the intersection ofresource efficiency and predictability of multi-core processors when itcomes to running component-based embedded software. In this paper, wepresent a software design framework addressing these challenges. Theframework includes both mapping of software components onto executabletasks, and the partitioning of the generated task set onto the cores ofa multi-core processor. This paper aims at enhancing resource efficiencyby optimizing the software design with respect to: 1) the inter-softwarecomponents communication cost, 2) the cost of synchronization amongdependent transactions of software components, and 3) the interaction ofsoftware components with the basic software services. An enginemanagement system, one of the most complex automotive sub-systems, isconsidered as a use case, and the experimental results show a reductionof up to 11.2\\textbackslash{}\\% total CPU usage on a quad-core processor, in comparisonwith the common framework in the literature.

To understand or validate the behavior of such a system,one needs to understand the components involved in combination withunderstanding how they are configured and composed. This becomesincreasingly difficult when components are implemented in variousprogramming languages, and composition is specified in externalartifacts. Moreover, tooling that supports in-depth system-wide analysisof such heterogeneous systems is lacking.Objective: This paper contributes a method to analyze and visualizeinformation flow in a component based system at various levels ofabstraction. These visualizations are designed to support thecomprehension needs of both safety domain experts and softwaredevelopers for, respectively, certification and evolution ofsafety-critical cyber-physical systems.Method: We build system-wide dependence graphs and use static programslicing to determine all possible end-to-end information flows throughand across a system's components. We define a hierarchy of fiveabstractions over these information flows that reduce visual distractionand cognitive overload, while satisfying the users' information needs.We improve on our earlier work to provide interconnected views thatsupport both systematic, as well as opportunistic navigation scenarios.Results: We discuss the design and implementation of our approach andthe resulting views in a prototype tool called FlowTracker. We summarizethe results of a qualitative evaluation study, carried out via tworounds of interview, on the effectiveness and usability of these views.We discuss a number of improvements, such as more selective informationpresentations, that resulted from the evaluation.Conclusion: The evaluation shows that the proposed approach and viewsare useful for understanding and validating heterogeneouscomponent-based systems, and address information needs that couldearlier only be met by manual inspection of the source code.

The proposed solutionallows modelling and analysing component-based embedded softwareapplications that are defined using a specific pattern in which eachcomponent is executed by a task with a specific priority. Theinfrastructure is also capable of analysing the system performance whenthe tasks access shared resources, using either immediate priorityceiling, or priority inheritance protocols, in order to avoid thepriority inversion problem. The paper shows the set of rules that enablethe transformation between an application, compliant with the proposeddesign pattern, and its corresponding PCM. Finally, a use case examplebased on a real system, and a set of tests that validates the analysisinfrastructure, are provided.

The adoption of a sound software architecture provides crucial aid in conveniently apportioning the relevantdevelopment concerns. This paper takes a software-centeredinterpretation of the ISO 42010 notion of architecture, enhancing itwith a component model that attributes separate concerns to distinctdesign views. The component boundary becomes the border betweenfunctional and extrafunctional concerns. The latter are treated asdecorations placed on the outside of components, satisfied byimplementation artifacts separate from and composable with theimplementation of the component internals. The approach was evaluated byindustrial users from several domains, with remarkably positive results.(C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The protocol conformancechecking problem consists of determining whether the actual behavior ofa component conforms to the protocol specifications on its ports. Inthis paper, we consider this problem in the context of the model-drivendevelopment (MDD) of embedded systems based on UML 2, in which UML 2state machines are used to specify component behavior. We provide adefinition of conformance which slightly extends those found in theliterature and reduce the conformance check to a state spaceexploration. We describe a tool implementing the approach using the JavaPathFinder software model checker and the MDD tool IBM Rational RoseRT,discuss its application to three case studies, and show how the toolrepeatedly allowed us to find unexpected conformance errors withencouraging performance. We conclude that the approach is promising forsupporting the modular development of embedded components in the contextof industrial applications of MDD.

The framework allows the users and developers tointegrate independently developed software components into one systemand provides a unified GUI In addition, it eliminates the efforts forre-designing or re-compiling the system for software upgrades. component-based software engineering; user interface; framework;software reliability; UML; ITS; GPS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & component-based software engineering & component-based software engineering & component-based software engin\\\\\n",

       "\t Component Framework for supporting safe and dynamic replacement inreal-time systems & 10.1016/j.riai.2013.11.007 & 2014 & Component Framework for supporting safe and dynamic replacement inreal-time systems In the last decades solutions have been provided for the real-timecomponent-based systems development as a base to increase productivityand reliability of their development as well as their maintenance.Solutions are increasingly appearing that allow controlled flexibilityin these systems, aiming to support dynamic execution through thecomponent replacement at run-time. So, component models are adaptedtrying to minimize conflicts integrating real-time and dynamicbehaviors, and achieving components replacements in a bounded time. Oneof the main challenges for this is to calculate the required times bythe different operations needed in a component replacement. The otherissue is to know the operating times of the component in the system whentheir implementations change along the life of the system. In this workthe implementation of a component framework implementation is describedproviding a partial solution for these problems. A component model isprovided together with the corresponding algorithms to assure thatcomponents can be loaded and replaced at run-time without interfering intheir execution deadlines. The model is designed to avoid failuresduring component replacements. Finally a validation of the presentedconcepts is provided.

       "\t An extensible framework for software configuration optimization onheterogeneous computing systems: Time and energy case study & 10.1016/j.infsof.2018.08.003 & 2019 & An extensible framework for software configuration optimization onheterogeneous computing systems: Time and energy case study Context Application of component based software engineering methods toheterogeneous computing (HC) enables different software configurationsto realize the same function with different non-functional properties(NFP). Finding the best software configuration with respect to multipleNFPs is a non-trivial task.Objective: We propose a Software Component Allocation Framework (SCAF)with the goal to acquire a (sub-) optimal software configuration withrespect to multiple NFPs, thus providing performance prediction of asoftware configuration in its early design phase. We focus on thesoftware configuration optimization for the average energy consumptionand average execution time.Method: We validated SCAF through its instantiation on a real-worlddemonstrator and a simulation. Firstly, we verified the correctness ofour model through comparing the performance prediction of six softwareconfigurations to the actual performance, obtained through extensivemeasurements with a confidence interval of 95\\textbackslash{}\\%. Secondly, todemonstrate how SCAF scales up, we performed software configurationoptimization on 55 generated use-cases (with solution spaces rangingfrom 10(30) to 30(70)) and benchmark the results against best performingrandom configurations.Results: The performance of a configuration as predicted by ourframework matched the configuration implemented and measured on areal-world platform. Furthermore, by applying the genetic algorithm andsimulated annealing to the weight function given in SCAF, we obtainsub-optimal software configurations differing in performance at most 7\\textbackslash{}\\%and 13\\textbackslash{}\\% from the optimal configuration (respectfully).Conclusion: SCAF is capable of correctly describing a HC platform andreliably predict the performance of software configuration in the earlydesign phase. Automated in the form of an Eclipse plugin, SCAF allowssoftware architects to model architectural constraints and preferences,acting as a multi-criterion software architecture decision supportsystem. In addition to said, we also point out several interestingresearch directions, to further investigate and improve our approach.

However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuringperipherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configurethe same peripheral on a different platform.

In this context,it is hard to build confidence that a design solution fulfills theapplication's requirements. This paper introduces a design flow for webservice applications of the representational state transfer style thatis based on a formal modeling language, the behaviour, interaction,priority (BIP) component framework. The proposed flow applies theprinciples of separation of concerns in a component-based design processthat supports the modular design and reuse of model artifacts. The BIPtools for state-space exploration allow verifying qualitative propertiesfor service responsiveness, ie, the timely handling of events. Moreover,essential quantitative properties are validated through statisticalmodel checking of a stochastic BIP model. All properties are preservedin actual implementation by ensuring that the deployed code isconsistent with the validated model. We illustrate the design of arepresentational state transfer sense-compute-control application for aWireless Personal Area Network architecture with nodes running theContiki operating system. The results validate qualitative andquantitative properties for the system and include the study of errorbehaviours.

Therefore, various efforts are being made tomake creating robots simpler and enable a larger audience to enter thisarea. This paper presents a brief overview on these efforts and aninitiative to promote the Internet of Things by proposing an intuitivelow-cost prototyping platform based on recycled electronics. Theproposed solution is composed of a recycled smartphone and IOIO board,the latter gives to the smartphone the capability to be interconnectedwith hardware modules and sensors.

We presenta service composition system that enables the goal-driven configurationof smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata andreasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-drivenapproaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use ofembedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups thatfulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its highdegree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamicenvironments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual servicesbecoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, weintegrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows tomodel the desired state of a smart environment graphically, therebyhiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possibleapplications of the presented system include the management of smarthomes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smartenvironments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcaredomains.Note to Practitioners-Machine tooling times are an important factorespecially when producing small batch sizes. Our approach holds thepotential to have manufacturing lines reconfigure themselves at runtime,based on descriptions of the functionality of individual devices. It caneven consider properties that influence the process indirectly(\\{''\\}nonfunctional\\{''\\}), such as the time or monetary cost of a process.We additionally implemented a system that makes these rather complexdescriptions understandable for nonspecialists.

We define a new semantics ofreconfigurations that allow automatic improvements of systemperformances at run-time even if there are no hardware faults. We applythis new semantics on two Benchmark Production Systems developed in ourresearch laboratory according to this industrial technology. We classifythereafter into three forms all possible reconfiguration scenarios to beapplied at run-time by a well-defined agent in order to adapt the systemto its environment according to well-defined conditions. The agent ismodelled by nested state machines according to the formalism NetCondition/Event Systems (NCES) which is an extension of Petri nets.

This software framework can accommodate themanagement of lifecycle data at all stages, especially data that occurin distribution, usage, maintenance and end-of-life stages, and use themto provide information and knowledge. The software framework is builtwith software components, based on a component-based concept withreference to a product lifecycle information acquisition and managementmodel proposed within this research study. Two actual lifecycleinformation management systems are created using the Framework in fieldtrials.

In addition tosupporting the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of individual DREsystems, component technologies must also support bounded latencies wheneffecting deployment changes to DRE systems in response to changingenvironmental conditions and operational requirements.Objective: The goals of this paper are to (1) study sources ofinefficiencies and non-deterministic performance in deploymentcapabilities for DRE systems and (2) devise solutions to overcome theseperformance problems.Method: The paper makes two contributions to the study of the deploymentand configuration of distributed component based applications. First, weanalyze how conventional implementations of the OMG's Deployment andConfiguration (D\\textbackslash{}\\&C) specification for component-based systems cansignificantly degrade deployment latencies. Second, we describearchitectural changes and performance optimizations implemented withinthe Locality-Enhanced Deployment and Configuration Engine (LE-DAnCE)implementation of the D\\textbackslash{}\\&C specification to obtain efficient anddeterministic deployment latencies.Results: We analyze the performance of LE-DAnCE in the context ofcomponent deployments on 10 nodes for a representative DRE systemconsisting of 1000 components and in a cluster environment with up to100 nodes. Our results show LE-DAnCE's optimizations provide a boundeddeployment latency of less than 2 s for the 1000 component scenario withjust a 4 percent jitter.Conclusion: The improvements contained in the LE-DAnCE infrastructureprovide an efficient and scaleable standards-based deployment system forcomponent-based enterprise DRE systems. In particular, deployment timeparallelism can improve deployment latency significantly, both duringpre-deployment analysis of the deployment plan and during the process ofinstalling and activating components.

However, the issue of saving resources by allocating severalcomponents to real-time tasks has gained little focus. Trade-offs whenallocating components to tasks are, e.g., CPU-overhead, footprint andintegrity.

Notably, some components may be used directly in anembedded software system, whereas most components must be specializedprior to reuse. Developers have to identify the variation points onthese components. In order to develop a reusable embedded softwaresystem, we will identify several variation points with some variants,and introduce some useful design patterns for implementing variationpoints. Consequently, we can customize an embedded software system justthrough attaching variants on corresponding variation point in oursystem.The design patterns we are using are property container, strategy,decorator, and model-view-controller.

CPPSs require acquisitionof production system data and smart data processing to extractinformation to improve the overall system performance. To achieve thatit is needed to bridge the gap between the control systems and higherlayers. This paper discusses an approach to use the IEC 61499 functionblock concept to exchange data between plant floor and higher layersusing an industrial standard like OPC UA. The OPC UA server offerssubscription mechanisms, making possible the integration of severalresources residing at plant floor. As it runs on embedded devices, theproposal makes possible to acquire plant information at low cost,enabling at the same time, a component-based design for enterprise plantfloor control with independence of the hardware platform used Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS); Industry 4.0; OPC-UA;Modbus/TCP & embedded devices & embedded devices & embedded devic\\\\\n",

This paper describes agamification framework that aims to facilitate achieving greater energyconservation in public buildings. The framework leverages IoT-enabledlow-cost devices, to improve energy disaggregation mechanisms thatprovide energy use and-consequently-wastage information at the device,area and end-user level. The identified wastages are concurrentlytargeted by a gamified application that motivates respective behavioralchanges combining team competition, virtual rewards and life simulation.Our solution is being developed iteratively with the end-users'engagement during the analysis, design, development and validationphases in public buildings located in three different countries:Luxembourg (Musee National d'Histoire et d'Art), Spain(EcoUrbanBuilding, Institut Catala d'Energia headquarters, Barcelona)and Greece (General Secretariat of the Municipality of Athens). energy efficiency; gamification; energy disaggregation; employee;behavioral economics; sustainability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & energy consumption & energy consumption & energy consumpt\\\\\n",

Data aggregation approaches havebeen widely used to enhance the performance of IoT applications. Suchapproaches reduce the number of packets that are transmitted bycombining multiple packets into one transmission unit, therebyminimising energy consumption, collisions and congestion. However,current data aggregation schemes restrict developers to a specificnetwork structure or cannot handle multi-hop data aggregation. In thispaper, we propose Hitch Hiker 2.0, a component binding model thatprovides support for multi-hop data aggregation. Hitch Hiker usescomponent meta-data to discover remote component bindings and toconstruct a multi-hop overlay network within the free payload space ofexisting traffic flows. Hitch Hiker 2.0 provides end-to-end routing oflow-priority traffic while using only a small fraction of the energy ofstandard communication. This paper extends upon our previous work byincorporating new mechanisms for decentralised route discovery andproviding additional application case studies and evaluation. We havedeveloped a prototype implementation of Hitch Hiker for the LooCIcomponent model. Our evaluation shows that Hitch Hiker consumes minimalresources and that using Hitch Hiker to deliver low-priority trafficreduces energy consumption by up to 32 \\textbackslash{}\\%.

Their users range from everyday commuters to policy makers andurban planners. Given the complexity of these systems and theirenvironment, their study in real settings is frequently unfeasible.Simulations help to address this problem, but present their own issues:there can be unintended mistakes in the transition from models to code;their platforms frequently bias modeling; and it is difficult to compareworks that use different models and tools. In order to overcome theseproblems, this paper proposes a framework for a model-driven developmentof these simulations. It is based on a specific modeling language thatsupports the integrated specification of the multiple facets of an ITS:people, their vehicles, and the external environment; and a network ofsensors and actuators conveniently arranged and distributed thatoperates over them. The framework works with a model editor to generatespecifications compliant with that language, and a code generator toproduce code from them using platform specifications. There are alsoguidelines to help researchers in the application of thisinfrastructure.

In this paper, the endogenous andexogenous aspects of resilience are of cornerstone importance in systemdesign and verification. Endogenous resilience is the inherent abilityof the system to detect and process internal faults and maliciousattacks. Exogenous resilience is the permanent capability of the systemto maintain a safe operation within its ambient environment. In thispaper, we present a predictive dual-sided contract-based formalmethodology to address both aspects of resilience on top of adistributed object-oriented component-based software model. It isillustrated by a case study of urban drone rescue systems. We exploitthe formalism of timed automata and the toolbox UPPAAL to predict byabstraction and analyze (simulate and verify) endogenous resilience.Instead of presenting the final models of the case study, we reflect ourexperience with UPPAAL in generic patterns of system design and contractspecification, reusable in other contexts with adaptations. The analysisof exogenous resilience is specific to the considered drone rescuesystem. It consists of synthesizing by iterative model-checking safefiight paths for the drones within a 3D virtual model of urbansurroundings true to modern cities.

We define a Control Component as asoftware unit to support control tasks of the system which is assumed tobe a network of components with precedence constraints. We define anagent-based architecture to handle automatic reconfigurations underwell-defined conditions by creating, deleting or updating components tobring the whole system into safe and optimal behaviors. To cover allpossible reconfiguration forms, we model the agent by nested statemachines according to the formalism Net Condition/Event Systems (abbr.NCES) which is an extension of Petri nets. We apply in addition a modelchecking to verify functional and extra-functional properties accordingto the temporal logic ``Computation Tree Logic\\{''\\} (abbr. CTL). The goalis to check the agent's reactivity after any evolution of theenvironment. Several complex networks can implement the system such thateach one is executed at a given time when a correspondingreconfiguration scenario is automatically applied by the agent. To checkthe correctness of each one of them, we apply in several steps arefinement-based approach that automatically specifies feasible ControlComponents according to NCES.

We define a Control Component as asoftware unit to support control tasks of the system, which is assumedto be a network of components with precedence constraints. We define anagent-based architecture to handle automatic reconfigurations underwell-defined conditions by creating, deleting, or updating components tobring the whole system into safe and optimal behaviors. To cover allpossible reconfiguration forms, we model the agent by nested statemachines according to the formalism Net Condition/Event Systems (NCESs),which is an extension of Petri nets. In addition, we apply a modelchecking to verify functional and extra-functional properties accordingto the temporal logic ``Computation Tree Logic\\{''\\} (CTL). The goal is tocheck the agent reactivity after any evolution of the environment.Several complex networks can implement the system, where each one isexecuted at a given time when a corresponding reconfiguration scenariois automatically applied by the agent. To check the correctness of eachone of them, we apply in several steps a refinement-based approach thatautomatically specifies feasible Control Components according to NCES.The model checker SESA is automatically applied in each step to verifydeadlock properties of new generated components, and it is manually usedto verify CTL-based properties according to user requirements. Weimplement the reconfiguration agent by three modules that allowinterpretations of environment evolutions, decisions of usefulreconfiguration scenarios, and finally, their applications.

Additionally,embedded objects and code provide a simple object-oriented approach toadding a visual form of LISP-style macros to a language. The ability tofreely combine source code and visual, interactive objects with oneanother allows for the construction of interactive programming tools andexperimentation with novel programming language extensions.

BCIs are gaining interestamong the virtual reality (VR) community since they have appeared aspromising interaction devices for virtual environments (VEs). The keyfeatures of the platform are (1) high modularity, (2) embedded tools forvisualization and feedback based on VR and 3D displays, (3) BCI designmade available to non-programmers thanks to visual programming, and (4)various tools offered to the different types of users. The platformfeatures are illustrated in this paper with two entertaining VRapplications based on a BCI. In the first one, users can move a virtualball by imagining hand movements, while in the second one, they cancontrol a virtual spaceship using real or imagined foot movements.Online experiments with these applications together with the evaluationof the platform computational performances showed its suitability forthe design of VR applications controlled with a BCI.

Furthermore, the DSP development tools available today areless advanced than in other embedded software design. This has lead toDSP software architectures that have not taken into account futureexpansion needs. Therefore, DSP software architectures have beeninherently closed. Now, as system complexity increases, this designmethodology becomes more of a burden, since it does not supportcomponent-based DSP software development that requires open interfaces.In this paper, mobile-communications DSP software architectures arestudied as cases, and key areas for improvements towards more open DSPsoftware development are identified.

Networking technology and standardshave an important role in driving this development. The omnipresence ofthe Internet via phone lines, TV cable, power lines, and wirelesschannels facilitates ubiquitous networks of smart devices that willsignificantly change the way we interact with home appliances. Homenetworking is foreseen to become one of the fastest growing markets inthe area of information technology. However, interoperability andflexibility of embedded devices are key challenges for making smart hometechnology accessible to a broad audience. In particular, the softwareprograms that determine the behavior of the smart home must facilitatecustomizability and extensibility. Unlike industrial applications,typically engineered by highly skilled programmers, control andautomation programs for the smart home should be understandable bylaypeople.

HW and SWcomponents can be described by means of different languages andaccording to different MoCs, toward a uniform intermediate descriptionbased on a rigorous semantics. A mapping from UNIVERCM to SystemC isproposed then to obtain a homogeneous description intended for fastsimulation, that can be also used as starting point for CMP designflows.

These mismatches, if notprevented during system design, have to be tolerated during runtime.This paper presents an architectural abstraction based on exceptionhandling for structuring fault-tolerant software systems. Thisabstraction comprises several components and connectors that promote anexisting untrusted software element into an idealised fault-tolerantarchitectural element. Moreover, it is considered in the context of arigorous software development approach based on formal methods forrepresenting the structure and behaviour of the software architecture.The proposed approach relies on a formal specification and verificationfor analysing exception propagation, and verifying importantdependability properties, such as deadlock freedom, and scenarios ofarchitectural reconfiguration. The formal models are automaticallygenerated using model transformation from UML diagrams: componentdiagram representing the system structure, and sequence diagramsrepresenting the system behaviour. Finally, the formal models are alsoused for generating unit and integration test cases that are used forassessing the correctness of the source code. The feasibility of theproposed architectural approach was evaluated on an embedded criticalcase study. exception handling; fault-tolerant software architecture; model-basedtest; model checking; software verification and validation & formal specification  & formal specification  & formal specif\\\\\n",

We presentCLOP, a platform that embeds code targeting heterogeneous computedevices in a convenient and clean way, allowing unobstructed data flowbetween the host code and the devices, reducing the amount of sourcecode by an order of magnitude. The CLOP compiler uses the standardfacilities of the D programming language to generate code strictly atcompile-time. In this paper we describe the CLOP language and the CLOPcompiler implementation.

The implicit approach usually outperforms theexplicit one, both in terms of time and memory.This paper introduces an implicit and component-based method for thesteady-state solution of reducible Markov regenerative processes: thestrongly connected components of the characteristic matrices of theprocess are used to identify a structure of components that is exploitedby the solution process to discriminate components of the process thathave a simple or a complex structure, and corresponding lower and highersolution costs. The solution then considers one component at a time,applying to each of them the simplest solution technique adequate to theactual component complexity. An implicit approach is followed, whichsaves the cost of building and storing the EMC, but makes non trivialthe identification of the strongly connected components.The paper shows the efficacy of the method both in theory and on a setof MRPs arising from queueing networks, stochastic Petri nets and fromthe stochastic model checking of Markov chains. In particular it isshown that the cost of the model checking of the Until formula of thestochastic logic CSLTA reduces to that of CSL if the component method isused. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Asmicroprocessors become more powerful, the software complexity ofreal-time embedded systems has increased steadily. The requirements forincreased functionality and adaptability make the development ofreal-time embedded software complex and error-prone. Component-baseddesign has been widely accepted as a compositional approach tofacilitate the design of complex systems. It provides a means fordecomposing a complex system into simpler subsystems and composing thesubsystems in a hierarchical manner. A system composed of real-timesubsystems with hierarchy is called a hierarchical real-time system.This paper describes a process algebraic approach to schedulabilityanalysis of hierarchical real-time systems. To facilitate modeling andanalyzing hierarchical real-time systems, we conservatively extend anexisting process algebraic theory based on ACSR-VP (Algebra ofCommunicating Shared Resources with Value-Passing) for theschedulability of real-time systems. We explain a method to model aresource model in ACSR-VP which may be partitioned for a subsystem. Wealso introduce schedulability relation to define the schedulability ofhierarchical real-time systems and show that satisfaction checking ofthe relation is reducible to deadlock checking in ACSR-VP and can bedone automatically by the tool support of VERSA (Verification, Executionand Rewrite System for ACSR).

Unlike some works which study the connection between formalapproaches and the highest (decisional) level of the robot softwarearchitecture, where deliberative activities such as planning,diagnostics, and execution control are conducted, we tackle the problemof using formal methods for developing modules of the functional levelof robots. Little attention has been drawn to the development of thesemodules whose robustness is paramount to the robustness of the overallplatform.To this end, we have successfully developed the G(theta n)oM/BIPcomponent based design approach and applied it to the functional levelof a complex exploration rover. Here, we report on this work, and showhow we: (i) produce a very fine grained formal computational model ofthe robot functional level; (ii) run the SIP engine on the real robot,which executes and enforces the model semantics at runtime; and (iii)check the model offline for deadlock-freedom, as well as other safetyproperties.Moreover, we also extended this paradigm in a number of promisingdirections: (i) introduced a real-time BIP engine which can now use andcontrol a timed BIP model; (ii) distributed the model and the engineover multiple CPUs: (iii) proposed a user-friendly language forspecifying constraints on the model; and (iv) linked the model with atemporal plan execution controller. Interestingly, although our approachwas initially proposed for the lowest level of robot architectures,these more recent extensions now allow us to model and manage thedeliberation taking place at the decisional layer.

From standard smart homes to automated buildings, includingother kind of domotics and inmotics solutions, every system must betested and validated before its installation. The current tools offeredby IoT and home automation vendors lack in emulation features close tothe real behavior of the devices. In many cases, delaying theverification actions until the hardware is acquired and installed maycause some drawbacks, for example, from the economic point of view. Thispaper presents a solution for emulating home automation environmentswhich are based on the KNX standard and can be represented byarchitectures of devices. The emulation consist of developing virtualimplementations of real devices which operate and communicate throughweb technology. The technology implementing these virtual devices allowsus to develop components which can provide different type of datarelated to the installation (audio, video, text, animations, images,etc.). The architectures can be managed using web services and theirbehavior can be tested through web user interfaces showing the mentioneddata. Furthermore, virtual and physical devices are connected tovalidate the interoperability between the real installation and theemulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, they break with the traditional layered architecturethat has been so successful for over 30 years. A fully fledgedcross-layer stack requires a sophisticated software design to bemaintainable and reusable. The Trustful Space-Time Protocol (TSTP) is across-layer protocol designed to deliver authenticated, encrypted,timed, and georeferenced messages containing data compliant with theInternational System of Units (SI) in a resource-efficient way. Byintegrating shared data from multiple networking services into a singlecommunication infrastructure, TSTP is able to eliminate replication ofinformation across services, achieving small overhead regarding controlmessages. The complexity of TSTP's features, its broad range - from theapplication to the Medium Access Control, - and its experimental naturebring diverse requirements beyond those usually considered in mostsoftware designs.

An event-driven architecture that makesuse of zero copy buffers and metadata is used to handle crosscuttingconcerns.

Unanticipatedquality defects in a component can be a major source of system failure.To address this issue, this paper suggests a design verificationapproach integrated into the model-driven, component-based developmentmethodology Marmot. The notion of abstract components-the basic buildingblocks of Marmot-helps to lift the level of abstraction, facilitateshigh-level reuse, and reduces verification complexity by localizingverification problems between abstract components before refinement andafter refinement. This enables the identification of unanticipateddesign errors in the early stages of development. This work introducesthe Marmot methodology, presents a design verification approach inMarmot, and demonstrates its application on the development of amu-controller-based abstraction of a car mirror control system. Anapplication on TinyOS shows that the approach helps to reuse models aswell as their verification results in the development process.

Major improvements in acute care and diagnostics have created atendency toward the chronification of formerly terminal conditions,requiring people with these conditions to learn how to self-manage.Mobile technologies hold promise as self-management tools due to theirubiquity and cost-effectiveness. The delivery of health-related servicesthrough mobile technologies (mobile health, mHealth) has grownexponentially in recent years. However, only a fraction of thesesolutions take into consideration the views of relevant stakeholderssuch as health care professionals or even patients. The use ofbehavioral change models (BCMs) has proven important in developingsuccessful health solutions, yet engaging patients remains a challenge.There is a trend in mHealth solutions called gamification that attemptsto use game elements to drive user behavior and increase engagement. Asit stands, designers of mHealth solutions for behavioral change inchronic conditions have no clear way of deciding what factors arerelevant to consider.Objective: The goal of this work is to discover factors for the designof mHealth solutions for chronic patients using negotiations betweenmedical knowledge, BCMs, and gamification.Methods: This study uses an embedded case study research methodologyconsisting of 4 embedded units: 1) cross-sectional studies of mHealthapplications; 2) statistical analysis of gamification presence; 3) focusgroups and interviews to relevant stakeholders; and 4) research throughdesign of an mHealth solution. The data obtained was thematicallyanalyzed to create a conceptual model for the design of mHealthsolutions.Results: The Model for Motivational Mobile-health Design (3MD) forchronic conditions guides the design of condition-oriented gamifiedbehavioral change mHealth solutions. The main components are (1)condition specific, which describe factors that need to be adjusted andadapted for each particular chronic condition; (2) motivation related,which are factors that address how to influence behaviors in an engagingmanner; and (3) technology based, which are factors that are directlyconnected to the technical capabilities of mobile technologies. The 3MDalso provides a series of high-level illustrative design questions fordesigners to use and consider during the design process.Conclusions: This work addresses a recognized gap in research andpractice, and proposes a unique model that could be of use in thegeneration of new solutions to help chronic patients. chronic conditions; consumer health informatics; gamification; healthbehavioral change; medical informatics; mHealth; user-centered design;information systems & Chronic conditions & chronic conditions & chronic condit\\\\\n",

Within this context, this papertargets the challenges that are concerned with the unambiguousrefinement of timing requirements, constraints and other timinginformation among various abstraction levels. Such information isrequired by the end-to-end timing analysis engines to providepre-run-time verification about the predictability of these systems. Thepaper proposes an approach to represent and refine such informationamong various abstraction levels. As a proof of concept, the approachprovides a representation of the timing information at the higher levelsusing the models that are developed with EAST-ADL and Timing AugmentedDescription Language. The approach then refines the timing informationfor the lower abstraction levels. The approach exploits the RubusComponent Model at the lower level to represent the timing informationthat cannot be clearly specified at the higher levels, such as triggerpaths in distributed chains. A vehicular-application case study isconducted to show the applicability of the proposed approach.

The general trend followed by theseapproaches is to provide ad-hoc models and tools for capturing theserequirements and for implementing their support within dedicated runtimeplatforms, limited to features of the targeted domain. The challenge isthen to propose more flexible solutions, where components reuse isdomain agnostic. In this article, we present a framework supportingcompositional construction and development of applications that mustmeet various extra-functional/domain-specific requirements. The keypoints of our contribution are: i) We target development ofcomponent-oriented applications where extra-functional requirements areexpressed as annotations on the units of composition in the applicationarchitecture. ii) These annotations are implemented as open andextensible component-based containers, achieving full separation offunctional and extra-functional concerns. iii) Finally, the fullmachinery is implemented using the Aspect-Oriented Programming paradigm.We validate our approach with two case studies: the first is related toreal-time and embedded applications, while the second refers to thedomain of distributed context-aware middleware. component-based frameworks; domain-specific software engineering;aspect-oriented software architectures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & component-based frameworks & component-based frameworks & component-based framework\\\\\n",

To ensure code quality and reliability,computer-aided analysis is also performed for the generated applicationsoftware in some frameworks. However, when the target is real-timeembedded systems, the correctness of the software in terms of satisfyingall user-given real-time and embedded constraints becomes a primaryobjective for such frameworks. To guarantee correctness, formalverification in the form of model checking is a viable solution due toits full automation capability. Nevertheless, little is known fromeither the existing literature or industrial experience on how formalverification can be integrated into an object-oriented applicationframework, whose primary purpose was previously only to design andgenerate application software. This work contributes to the state-of-arttechnology by showing how a design framework and a verificationframework can be integrated. Three main issues are tackled: (i) what toverify?; (ii) when to verify?; and (iii) how to verify? As a solution tothese three issues the authors propose a mapping from theobject-oriented model to a formal model, a schedule-verify-map strategyand a compositional verification methodology, respectively. These havebeen implemented in a component-based framework and experimentsperformed to illustrate their feasibility. Due to the incorporation ofindustry de-facto standards such as real-time unified modelling languageand real-time Java, in the proposed techniques it should now be possiblefor an engineer to gain access to theoretically proven formalverification technologies that would otherwise be considered to beinaccessible to an engineer unskilled in verification techniques.

Passive replication minimizes resourceconsumption by only activating redundant replicas in case of failures,as typically, providing and applying state updates is less resourcedemanding than requesting execution. However, most existing solutionsfor passive fault tolerance are usually designed and configured atdesign time, explicitly and statically identifying the most criticalcomponents and their number of replicas, lacking the needed flexibilityto handle the runtime dynamics of distributed component-based embeddedsystems. This paper proposes a cost-effective adaptive fault tolerancesolution with a significant lower overhead compared to a strict activeredundancy-based approach, achieving a high error coverage with aminimum amount of redundancy. The activation of passive replicas iscoordinated through a feedback-based coordination model that reduces thecomplexity of the needed interactions among components until a newcollective global service solution is determined, hence improving theoverall maintainability and robustness of the system.

However,existing approaches have critical weakness. First, existing approachestypically require a component's source code to be available if you wishto strip (or re-insert) checks. Second, documentation of the contract iseither distributed separately from the component or embedded in thecomponent's source code. Third, enabling and disabling specific kinds ofchecks on separate components from independent vendors can be asignificant challenge. This paper describes an approach to representingcontracts for .NET components using attributes. This contractinformation can be retrived from the compiled component's metadata andused for many purposes. The paper also describes nContract, a tool thatautomatically generates run-time checks from embedded contracts. Suchrun-time checks can be generated and added to a system withoutrequiringt source code access or recompilation. Further, when checks fora given component are excluded, they impose no run-time overhead.Finally, a highly expressive, fine-grained mechanism for controllinguser preferences about which specific checks are enabled or disabled ispresented. design by contract; assertion checkers; dynamic verification;component-based software; binary components; preconditions;postconditions; invariants; coding techniques; debugging aids;specification & design contract & design contract & design contract\\\\\n",

However, standard componentmodels and tools are not suitable for this type of system, since they donot explicitly address real time, memory or cost constraints. This paperpresents a new predictable component model for real-time systems(UM-RTCOM) together with a set of tools to support it. The environmentallows new components to be developed which can then be assembled tobuild complete applications, including hardware interaction. The modelincludes support for real-time analysis at the component and applicationlevel. The analysis is achieved by combining component meta-informationin the form of an abstract behaviour model and a method to measureworst-case execution times in the final platform. Additionally, wepropose an implementation model based on RT-CORBA where the developeruses the UM-RTCOM components and a set of tools to map these elements toelements of the desired platform.

This paper investigates the use ofonline MPC, in which at each step, an optimization problem is solved, onboth a programmable automation controller (PAC) and a programmable logiccontroller (PLC). Three different optimization routines to solve thequadratic program were investigated with respect to their applicabilityon these devices. To this end, an air heating setup was built andselected as a small-scalemulti-input single-output system. It turns outthat the code generator (CVXGEN) is not suited for the PLC as therequired programming language is not available and the programmingconcept with preallocated memory consumes too much memory. The Hildrethand qpOASES algorithms successfully controlled the setup running on thePLC hardware. Both algorithms perform similarly, although it takes moretime to calculate a solution for qpOASES. However, if the problem sizeincreases, it is expected that the high number of required iterationswhen the constraints are hit will cause the Hildreth algorithm to exceedthe necessary time to present a solution. For this small heating problemunder test, the Hildreth algorithm is selected as most useful on a PLC. NA & embedded controllers & embedded controllers & embedded control\\\\\n",

While theharvested power is often less than 1 mW, the commercial-off-the-shelfpower management circuits designed for conventional battery applicationsoperate in much higher power. A designated power management module forsub-mW energy harvester is proposed in this article to increase theenergy conversion efficiency and extend the energy storage lifetime forsmall input power. The proposed module consists of discretecomponent-based pulse-width modulation (PWM) controlled synchronousboost converter structured impedance matching circuit andsupercapacitor/micro-battery hybrid energy storage. The synchronousboost converter-based power management circuit achieves 79\\textbackslash{}\\% conversionefficiency at the input power of 0.5 mW. The power loss during theenergy conversion is significantly reduced and thus allows wirelesssensor nodes to be powered from a minimum of 120 Lux fluorescent lightwith a photovoltaic cell smaller than a credit card. Thesupercapacitor/micro-battery energy storage provides lifetime of morethan 73 h when no external energy is available. The experimental resultswith 25 energy harvester-powered wireless sensor nodes demonstrate thatthe practical ultra-low-power design makes sub-1-mW energy harvesterpower management applicable.

According tothis Standard, a Function Block (FB) is all event-triggered componentand an application is an FB network that has to meet temporal propertiesaccording to user requirements. If a reconfiguration scenario is appliedat run-time, then the FB network implementing the application is totallychanged or modified. To cover all possible cases, we classify suchscenarios into three classes and we define an agent-based architecturedesigned with nested state machines to automatically handle all possiblereconfigurations. To verify and assign Function Blocks corresponding toeach reconfiguration scenario into the execution environment, we definean approach based on the exploration of reachability graphs to verifytemporal properties. This approach constructs feasible Operating Systemtasks encoding the FB network that corresponds to each scenario.Therefore, the application is considered as sets of Operating System(OS) tasks where each set is to load in memory when the correspondingreconfiguration scenario is applied by the agent.

These goals are at odds, and compilers can only rarelytranslate expressive high-level programs to modern hardware platforms ina way that makes best use of the available resources.Generative programming is a promising alternative to fully automatictranslation. Instead of writing down the target program directly,developers write a program generator, which produces the target programas its output. The generator can be written in a high-level, genericstyle and can still produce efficient, specialized target programs. Inpractice, however, developing high-quality program generators requires avery large effort that is often hard to amortize.We present lightweight modular staging (LMS), a generative programmingapproach that lowers this effort significantly. LMS seamlessly combinesprogram generator logic with the generated code in a single program,using only types to distinguish the two stages of execution. Throughextensive use of component technology, LMS makes a reusable andextensible compiler framework available at the library level, allowingprogrammers to tightly integrate domain-specific abstractions andoptimizations into the generation process, with common genericoptimizations provided by the framework.LMS is well suited to develop embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs)and has been used to develop powerful performance-oriented DSLs fordemanding domains such as machine learning, with code generation forheterogeneous platforms including GPUs.

As a result, the level ofportability of the source code can decrease significantly. Moreover,portability is considered to be a major challenge when FieldProgrammable Gate Arrays are used. Specialized instruction sets arewidely used for high performance military radio platforms. Consequently,finding a solution to increase portability of SCA applications acrossdifferent operating environments could provide significant costreductions. This paper describes how the Open Computing Language (OpenCL(TM)) can be used in conjunction with the SCA to increase theportability of applications that need to perform intensive signalprocessing.

Without complementary verification andcertification methods the benefits of these development techniques arereduced. As part of certification, it is necessary to show a system isacceptably safe which subsumes both the normal and abnormal (failure)cases. However, nonfunctional properties, such as safety and failures,are abstraction breakers, cutting across multiple components. Also, muchof the work on component-based engineering has been applied tosoftware-based systems rather than field programmable gate array(FPGA)-based systems whose use is becoming more popular in industry. Inthis paper, we show how a modular design embedded on a FPGA can beexhaustively analyzed (from a safety perspective) to derive the failureand safety properties to give the evidence needed for a safety case. Thespecific challenges faced are analyzing the fault characteristics ofindividual electronic components, combining the results across softwaremodules, and then feeding this into a system safety case. A secondarybenefit of taking this approach is that there is less uncertainty in theperformance of the device, hence, it can be used for higher integritysystems. Finally, design improvements can be specifically targeted atareas of safety concern, leading to more optimal utilization of the FPGAdevice.

In most actor-oriented models, actors areself-contained and data channels are the only sharable object betweenactors, and they compose a system in a flat layer. In contrast, it iscommon to use shared library functions and construct vertically layeredsoftware for efficiency and modularity. To fill this gap betweenmodeling and implementation, we propose a special actor, library task,with new types of ports: library master port and library slave port. Itis a sharable and mappable object that defines a set of functioninterfaces inside. N:1 master-slave connection allows sharing a librarytask and the master-slave connection can specify vertically layeredsoftware and client-server applications naturally.To support the library task in our embedded software design environment,we develop an automatic mapping algorithm as well as an automatic codegenerator. The design environment with the library task is applied fortwo target platforms: IBM CELL Broadband Engine and an ARM-basedmulticore simulator. Preliminary experiments show that the specialactor, or library task, extends the expression power of the previousactor model with efficiently generated codes.

For embedded scenarios with strictenergy constraints such as automotive image processing, FPGAs representa feasible power-efficient computer platform. Unfortunately, theirhardware-driven design concept results in long development cycles andimpedes their acceptance in industrial practice. Additionally, theverification of the FPGA's correctness and its performance figures areunavailable until a very late development stage, which is criticalduring design space exploration and the integration in complex embeddedsystems. Weakly-programmable architectures, supporting design andrun-time reuse via flexible hardware components, represent a promisingand efficient FPGA development approach. However, they currently lacksuitable design and verification methodologies for real-time scenarios.Therefore, this paper proposes a system-level FPGA development conceptfor video applications with weakly-programmable hardware components. Itcombines rapid software prototyping with component-based FPGA design andadvanced formal real-time analysis and code generation techniques. Thepresented approach enables an early verification of the application'scorrectness, including exact performance figures. It provides asoftware-level verification of weakly-programmable hardware componentsand an automated assembly of the final hardware design. The developedtools and their usability are demonstrated by a binarization and a denseblock matching application, which represents a basic preprocessing stepin automotive image processing for driver assistance systems.

The majordistinguishing aspects of this component-based approach are thepossibility to describe nominal hardware and software operations, hybrid(and timing) aspects, as well as probabilistic faults and theirpropagation and recovery. Moreover, it supports dynamic (i.e.on-the-fly) reconfiguration of components and inter-componentconnections. The operational semantics gives a precise interpretation ofspecifications by providing a mapping onto networks of event-dataautomata. These networks are then subject to different kinds of formalanalysis such as model checking, safety and dependability analysis andperformance evaluation. Mature tool support realizes these analyses.

When considering resilient embedded systems that must complywith stringent dependability requirements, the challenge is evengreater, as evolution must not impair dependability attributes.Maintaining dependability properties when facing changes is, indeed, theexact definition of resilient computing. In this paper, we consider theevolution of systems with respect to their dependability mechanisms andshow how such mechanisms can evolve with the system evolution, in thecase of ROS, the robot operating system. We provide a synthesis of theconcepts required for resilient computing using a component-basedapproach. We particularly emphasize the process and the techniquesneeded to implement an adaptation layer for fault tolerance mechanisms.In the light of this analysis, we address the implementation of adaptivefault tolerance on ROS in 2 steps: Firstly, we provide an architectureto implement fault tolerance mechanisms in ROS, and secondly, wedescribe the actual adaptation of fault tolerance mechanisms in ROS.Beyond the implementation details given in the paper, we draw thelessons learned from this work and discuss the limits of this run-timesupport to implement adaptive fault tolerance features in embeddedsystems. adaptive fault tolerance; resilience; ROS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & system evolution & system evolution & system evolut\\\\\n",

Decisions made during this phase impact the quality, cost,performance, and the delivery date of the final product. Over the pastdecade or more, various partitioning approaches have been proposed. Amajority operate at a relatively fine granularity and use a low-levelexecutable specification as the starting point. This presents problemsif the context is families of industrial products with frequent releaseof upgraded or new members. Managing complexity using a low-levelspecification is extremely challenging and impacts developerproductivity. Designing using a high-level specification andcomponent-based development, although a better option, imposes componentintegration and replacement problems during system evolution and newproduct release. A new approach termed Concept-Based Partitioning ispresented that focuses on system evolution, product lines, andlarge-scale reuse when partitioning. Beginning with information from UML2.0 sequence diagrams and a concept repository concepts are identifiedand used as the unit of partitioning within a specification. Amethodology for the refinement of interpart communication in the systemspecification using sequence diagrams is also presented. Changelocalization during system evolution, composability during large-scalereuse, and provision for configurable feature variations for a productline are facilitated by a Generic Adaptive Layer (GAL) around selectedconcepts.

They increase confidence andpotentially provide rich feedback. However, with increasing complexity,verification tools themselves are more likely to contain errors.In contrast to automatic verification tools, higher-order theoremprovers use mathematically founded proof strategies checked by a smallproof checker to guarantee selected properties. Thus, they enjoy a highlevel of trustability. Properties of software and hardware systems andtheir justifications can be encapsulated into a certificate, therebyguaranteeing correctness of the systems, with respect to the properties.These results offer a much higher degree of confidence than resultsachieved by verification tools. However, higher-order theorem proversare usually slow, due to their general and minimalistic nature. Even forsmall systems, a lot of human interaction is required for establishing acertificate.In this work, we combine the advantages of automatic verification tools(i.e., speed and automation) with those of higher-order theorem provers(i.e., high level of trustability). The verification tool generates acertificate for each invocation. This is checked by the higher-ordertheorem prover, thereby guaranteeing the desired property. Thegeneration of certificates is much easier than producing the analysisresults of the verification tool in the first place. In our work, we areable to create certificates that come with an algorithmic description ofthe proof of the desired property as justification. We concentrate onverification tools that generate invariants of systems and certifyautomatically that these do indeed hold. Our approach is applied to thecertification of the verdicts of a deadlock-detection tool for anasynchronous component-based language.

Reducingthe energy overheads of sensor data acquisition and processing isessential to ensure the successful continuous operation of suchapplications, especially on battery-limited mobile devices. To achievethis goal, this paper presents a framework, called ACQUA, for`acquisition-cost' aware continuous query processing. ACQUA replaces thecurrent paradigm, where the data is typically streamed (pushed) from thesensors to the one or more smartphones, with a pull-based asynchronousmodel, where a smartphone retrieves appropriate blocks of relevantsensor data from individual sensors, as an integral part of the queryevaluation process. We describe algorithms that dynamically optimize thesequence (for complex stream queries with conjunctive and disjunctivepredicates) in which such sensor data streams are retrieved by the queryevaluation component, based on a combination of (a) the communicationcost \\textbackslash{}\\& selectivity properties of individual sensor streams, and (b) theoccurrence of the stream predicates in multiple concurrently executingqueries. We also show how a transformation of a group of stream queriesinto a disjunctive normal form provides us with significantly greaterdegrees of freedom in choosing this sequence, in which individual sensorstreams are retrieved and evaluated. While the algorithms can apply to abroad category of sensor-based applications, we specifically demonstratetheir application to a scenario where multiple stream processing queriesexecute on a single smartphone, with the sensors transferring their dataover an appropriate PAN technology, such as Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11.Extensive simulation experiments indicate that ACQUA's intelligentbatch-oriented data acquisition process can result in as much as 80 \\textbackslash{}\\%reduction in the energy overhead of continuous query processing, withoutany loss in the fidelity of the processing logic.

Typically, suchsystems consist of embedded computers that monitor and control physicalprocesses in a feedback loop. While modern electronic systems areincreasingly characterized as CPS, their design and synthesis still relyon traditional methods, which lack systematic and automated techniquesfor accomplishment.Recently, IEC 61499 has been proposed as a standard for designingindustrial process-control and measurement systems. It prescribes acomponent-based approach for developing industrial automation softwareusing function blocks. Executable code can then be automaticallygenerated and simulated from these function blocks. This bodes well fordesigners of CPS, who are more likely to be experts in specificindustrial domains, rather than in computer science. The intuitivegraphical nature and automatic code synthesis of IEC 61499 programs willalleviate the programming burden of industrial engineers, while ensuringmore reliable software. While software synthesis from IEC 61499 programsis not new the generation of efficient code from them has been wanting.This has made it difficult for function blocks to be used in softwaredevelopment for resource-constrained embedded controllers commonlyemployed in CPS. To address this, we present an approach that cangenerate very efficient code from function block descriptions.Experimental results from a benchmark suite shows that our approachproduces substantially faster and smaller code compared to existingtechniques.

In this paper, weintroduce a novel model-based approach for constructing correctdistributed implementation of component-based models constrained bypriorities. We argue that model-based methods are especially of interestin the context of distributed embedded systems due to their inherentcomplexity (e.g., caused by non-deterministic nature of distributedsystems). Our method is designed based on three phases oftransformation. The input is a model specified in terms of a set ofbehavioral components that interact through a set of high-levelsynchronization primitives (e.g., rendezvous and broadcasts) andpriority rules for scheduling purposes. The first phase transforms theinput model into a model that has no priorities. Then, the second phasetransforms the deprioritized model into another model that resolvesdistributed conflicts by incorporating a solution to the committeecoordination problem. Finally, the third phase generates distributedcode using asynchronous point-to-point message passing primitives (e.g.,TCP sockets). All transformations preserve the properties of their inputmodel by ensuring observational equivalence. All the transformations areimplemented and our experiments validate their effectiveness.

In this paper, asoftware interface that enables the java-digital signal processing(J-DSP) visual programming environment to communicate in a two-waymanner with a wireless sensor network is presented. This interface wasdeveloped by writing nesC (an extension to the C programming languagefor sensors) code that enables J-DSP to issue commands to multiplewireless sensor motes, activate specific transducers, and analyze datausing any of the existing J-DSP signal processing functions in realtime. A series of exercises were developed and disseminated to providehardware experiences to signals and systems and signal processingundergraduate students.

However, as the number ofcomponent-based applications in modern automotive embedded systems growsrapidly and the hardware topology becomes increasingly complex,deploying such large number of components in automotive distributedsystem in manual way is over-dependent on experience of engineers whichin turn is time consuming. Furthermore, the resource limitation andscheduling analysis make the problems more complex for developers tofind out an approximate optimal deploying approach in systemintegration. In this paper, we propose a novel method to deploy theAUTOSAR components onto ECUs with the following features. First, aclustering algorithm is designed for deploying components automaticallywithin relatively low time complexity. Second, a fitness function isdesigned to balance the ECUs load. The goal of our approach is tominimize the communication cost over all the runnable entities whilemeeting all corresponding timing constraints and balancing all the ECUsload. The experiment results show that our approach is efficient and haswell performance by comparing with other existing methods in specificand synthetic data set.

The synchronous dataflow (SDF) model isparticularly well-suited to dataflow-based graphical programming becauseits restricted semantics offer strong formal properties and significantcompile-time predictability, while capturing the behavior of a largeclass of important signal processing applications. When synthesizingsoftware for embedded signal processing applications, criticalconstraints arise due to the limited amounts of memory. In this paper,we propose a solution to the problem of jointly optimizing the code anddata size when converting SDF programs into software implementations.We consider two approaches. The first is a customization to acyclicgraphs of a bottom-up technique, called pairwise grouping of adjacentnodes (PGAN), that was proposed earlier for general SDF graphs. We showthat our customization to acyclic graphs significantly reduces thecomplexity of the general PGAN algorithm, and we present a formal studyof our modified PGAN technique that rigorously establishes itsoptimality for a certain class of applications. The second approach thatwe consider is a top-down technique, based on a generalized minimum-cutoperation, that was introduced recently in \\{{[}\\}14{]}. We present theresults of an extensive experimental investigation on the performance ofour modified PGAN technique and the top-down approach and on thetradeoffs between them. Based on these results, we conclude that thesetwo techniques complement each other, and thus, they should both beincorporated into SDF-based software implementation environments inwhich the minimization of memory requirements is important.

Areal-time contract determines the fulfillment of a component's responsetime requirements when it operates in a client-server relation withother components. This represents a typical contract testing scenario inwhich the client component needs to assess the timely response of anassociated server component according to its usage profile of thatserver.

However, reliance on suchschemes may expose the network to large impacts - including blackouts -if the SPS does not respond as designed, so the deployment of SPS shouldbalance risks and benefits. This paper formulates a risk-basedcost-benefit framework that allows the operator to strike an optimalbalance between constraint costs and risks of demand curtailment due tomalfunctioning SPS. It is applied to a simple 4-bus power systeminspired by the GB network, for which an exact optimisation problem canbe formulated. A component-based dependability model is developed forthe SPS to determine its failure modes and associated probabilities. Theresulting cost-minimisation problem is solved for a range of operatingconditions and SPS reliability levels. The results consistently showcost savings from the use of an SPS, even if it is highly unreliable,when a hedging strategy may be used. The optimal solution is highlysensitive to the problem parameters, but it is demonstrated that optimaloperational strategies are associated with particular SPS outcomes. Thisfinding may be used as empirical guidance to develop operationalstrategies for complex networks with unreliable SPS. (C) 2016 TheAuthors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Because churned objects areshort-lived, they appear to be good candidates for stack allocation.Unfortunately, most churned objects escape their allocating function,making escape analysis ineffective.We reduce object churn with three contributions. First, we formalize twomeasures of churn, capture and control (15). Second, we developlightweight dynamic analyses for measuring both capture and control.Third, we develop an algorithm that uses capture and control to inlineportions of the call graph to make churned objects non-escaping,enabling churn optimization via escape analysis.JOLT is a lightweight dynamic churn optimizer that uses our algorithms.We embedded JOLT in the JIT compiler of the IBM J9 commercial JVM, andevaluated JOLT on large application frameworks, including Eclipse andJBoss. We found that JOLT eliminates over 4 times as many allocations asa state-of-the-art escape analysis alone.

       "\t Predictable integration and reuse of executable real-time components & 10.1016/j.jss.2013.12.040 & 2014 & Predictable integration and reuse of executable real-time components We present the concept of runnable virtual node (RVN) as a means toachieve predictable integration and reuse of executable real-timecomponents in embedded systems. A runnable virtual node is acoarse-grained software component that provides functional and temporalisolation with respect to its environment. Its interaction with theenvironment is bounded both by a functional and a temporal interface,and the validity of its internal temporal behaviour is preserved whenintegrated with other components or when reused in a new environment.Our realization of RVN exploits the latest techniques for hierarchicalscheduling to achieve temporal isolation, and the principles fromcomponent-based software-engineering to achieve functional isolation. Ituses a two-level deployment process, i.e. deploying functional entitiesto RVNs and then deploying RVNs to physical nodes, and thus also givesdevelopment benefits with respect to composability, system integration,testing, and validation. In addition, we have implemented a server-basedinter-RVN communication strategy to not only support the predictableintegration and reuse properties of RVNs by keeping the communicationcode in a separate server, but also increasing the maintainability andflexibility to change the communication code without affecting thetiming properties of RVNs. We have applied our approach to a case study,implemented in the ProCom component technology executing on top of aFreeRTOS-based hierarchical scheduling framework and present the resultsas a proof-of-concept.

Factors affectingthe software complexity of components embedded in an ECU depend not onlyon their interface and interaction properties, but also on thestructural constraints characterized by a component's functionalsemantics and timing constraints described by AUTomotive Open SystemARchitecture (AUTOSAR) languages. Traditional constraint complexitymeasures are not adequate for the components in embedded softwaresystems as they do not yet sufficiently provide a measure of thecomplexity due to timing constraints which are important for quantifyingthe dynamic behavior of components at run-time. This paper presents amethod for measuring the constraint complexity of components inautomotive embedded software systems at the specification level. Itfirst enables system designers to define non-deterministic constraintson the event chains associated with components using the AUTOSAR-basedModeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems (MARTE)-UML andTiming Augmented Description Language (TADL). Then, system analysts useUnified Modeling Language (UML)-compliant Object Constraint Language(OCL) and its Real-time extension (RT-OCL) to specify the structural andtiming constraints on events and event chains and estimate theconstraint complexity of components using a measure we have developed. Apreliminary version of the method was presented in M. Garg and R. Lai,Measuring the constraint complexity of automotive embedded softwaresystems, in Proc. Int. Conf. Data and Software Engineering, 2014, pp.1-6. To demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we have applied it toan automotive Anti-lock Brake System (ABS).

This is a challenging,time-consuming, and error-prone process requiring significantinteraction between engineers and software programmers. Furthermore, theresulting code generally lacks. modularity and robustness in thepresence of failure. Model-based programming addresses theselimitations, allowing engineers to program reactive systems byspecifying high-level control strategies and by assembling commonsensemodels of the system hardware and software. In executing a controlstrategy, model-based executives reason about the models ``on the fly,`` to track system state, diagnose faults, and perform reconfigurations.This paper develops the Reactive Model-Based Programming Language (RMPL)and its executive, called Titan. RMPL provides the features ofsynchronous, reactive languages, with the added ability of reading andwriting to state variables that are hidden within the physical plantbeing controlled. Titan executes an RMPL program using extensivecomponent-based declarative models of the plant to track states, analyzeanomalous situations, and generate novel control sequences. Within itsreactive control loop, Titan employs propositional inference to deducethe system's current and desired states, and it employs model-basedreactive planning to move the plant from the current to the desiredstate. constraint programming; model-based autonomy; model-based execution;model-based programming; model-based reasoning; robotic execution;synchronous programming & ; robotic execution;synchronous programming & ; robotic execution;synchronous programming & ; robotic execution;synchronous program\\\\\n",

The results demonstrate excellent performanceof the proposed algorithms and circuits in all realistic conditions. Thecode acquisition circuit proposed an adaptive testing window for singledwell serial search method.

In this and other areas ofmanufacturing and materials handling, these legacy automationtechnologies are increasingly limiting for the growing demand forsystems that are reconfigurable, fault tolerant, and easy to maintain.IEC 61499 Function Blocks is an emerging architectural framework for thedesign of distributed industrial automation systems and their reusablecomponents. A number of architectures have been suggested for multiagentand holonic control systems that incorporate function blocks. This paperpresents a multiagent control approach for a baggage handling system(BHS) using IEC 61499 Function Blocks. In particular, it focuses ondemonstrating a decentralized control system that is scalable,reconfigurable, and fault tolerant. The design follows the automationobject approach, and produces a function block component representing asingle section of conveyor. In accordance with holonic principles, thiscomponent is autonomous and collaborative, such that the structure andthe behavior of a BHS can be entirely defined by the interconnection ofthese components within the function block design environment.Simulation is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the agent-basedcontrol system and a utility is presented for real-time viewing of thesesystems. Tests on a physical conveyor test system demonstrateddeployment to embedded control hardware.Note to Practitioners-It is well recognized that flexibility andreconfigurability of manufacturing systems pose a major challenge totheir automation. There is also a belief among automation researchersthat decentralized intelligent control will contribute significantly tothe flexibility of manufacturing systems. Achievements in practicalapplications using decentralized control have been limited by thestanding tradition of automation design with centralized logic executedon programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The new programmingarchitecture defined by IEC 61499 is specifically designed fordistributed applications and invalidates many existing assumptions aboutthe difficulty of implementing these systems using partially or fullydecentralized execution.In this paper, we present results of developing a distributed automationarchitecture based on IEC 61499 for airport baggage handling systems.Such systems are constantly undergoing reconfiguration, repair andexpansion so flexibility is a vital design metric.

In such resource-poor platforms, the ability to efficientlydelimit and reconfigure the necessary portion of sensor software-insteadof updating the full binary image-is of vital importance. However, mostexisting approaches in this field have not been adopted widely to datedue to the extensive use of WSN resources or lack of generality. In thisarticle, we therefore consider WSN programming models and runtimereconfiguration models as two interrelated factors and we present anintegrated approach for addressing efficient reprogramming in WSNs. Themiddleware solution we propose, REMOWARE, is characterized by mitigatingthe cost of post-deployment software updates on sensor nodes via thenotion of in situ reconfigurability and providing a component-basedprogramming abstraction in order to facilitate the development ofdynamic WSN applications. Our evaluation results show that REMOWAREimposes a very low energy overhead in code distribution and componentreconfiguration and consumes approximately 6\\textbackslash{}\\% of the total code memoryon a TELOSB sensor platform.

In the hierarchical component, the number ofpossible configurations of the composition is reduced to a small numberof hierarchical configurations. Only these hierarchical configurationshave to be considered when the hierarchical component is used in furthercompositions such that design complexity is reduced at each hierarchicallevel.

With this increasing complexity of the system design, ithas become very critical to enhance system design productivity to meetthe time-to-market demands and reduce product development cost.Real-time embedded system designers are facing extreme challenges in theunderlying architectural design selection. This involves the selectionof a programmable, concurrent, heterogeneous multiprocessor architectureplatform. Such a multiprocessor-system-on-chip platform has setinnovative trends for the real-time systems and system-on-chipdesigners. The consequences of this trend imply a shift in concern fromcomputation and sequential algorithms to modeling concurrency,synchronization, and communication in every aspect of hardware andsoftware co-design and development. Therefore, there is a need for ahigh level methodology that can provide a complete system modeling andarchitecture/component selection platform. The proposed six-step systemmodeling methodology provides a process for performance driven componentselection, to avoid costly iterative system design re-spins, therebyenhancing system design productivity.

Currently, many approaches are proposed to aid the developmentand evaluation of secure components. However, it is well known amongpractitioners that, like any other software entities, components cannotbe completely secure. This fact leads us to incorporate intrusiondetection facilities to equip components with mechanisms to discoverintrusions against components. In this paper, we present a framework fordeveloping components with intrusion detection capabilities. Thisframework uses UMLintr, a UML profile for intrusion specifications. Theprofile allows developers to specify intrusion scenarios using UMLdiagrams. Specifying intrusion scenarios using the same language that isused for specifying software behavior eliminates the need for separatelanguages for describing intrusions. Other software specificationlanguages can be easily adopted into this framework. The outcome of thisframework are components equipped with intrusion detectors. Based onUMLintr, a prototype is built and used to generate signatures for someintrusions included in the benchmark DARPA attack datasets. Furthermore,we describe an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which uses thesesignatures to detect component intrusions.

The evaluationhas been carried out by comparing the automatically generated code withthe manually implemented code, both compliant to the same SDLspecification: this comparison is based on a selection of metricsmeasured on both codes by means of commercial static analysis tools.Notwithstanding the different structure of the two codes, weappropriately selected and aggregated the obtained results in order touse them as indicators of code size, control flow complexity andintegration flow complexity. For a better comparison of the two codes,we have also introduced a novel complexity metric, which compares thecontrol flow complexity with the integration flow of the two differentsoftware architectures. The aim of the paper is not merely to evaluatethe code generator used, but rather to propose a set of techniques thatcan be used to conduct similar evaluations.

However, they do not handle the high levelcomplexity related to discretization methods and physical models.Generative programming and Domain Specific Languages (DSL) are keytechnologies allowing to write code with a high level expressivelanguage and take advantage of the efficiency of generated code with lowlevel services. DSL may be embedded in host languages like Python orC++. Such languages, named in that case Domain Specific EmbeddedLanguages (DSEL), are applied for instance in frameworks like Fenics orFeel++ which are dedicated to the domain of Finite Element (FE) methodsand Galerkin methods. ArcFVDSL is a DSEL developed on top of the Arcaneframework, aiming to implement various lowest order methods(Finite-Volume (FV), Mimetic Finite Difference (MFD), Mixed HybridFinite Volume (MHFV), etc.) for diffusive problems on general meshes. Inthis paper, we present various implementations of different complexacademic problems. We focus on the capability of the language to allowthe description and the resolution of these problems with severallowest-order methods. We illustrate the benefits of such technologycombined to runtime system tools like Heterogeneous Abstract RunTimeSystem (HARTS) and its ability to handle seamlessly new heterogeneousarchitectures with multi-core processors enhanced by General Purposecomputing on Graphics Processing Units (GP-GPU). We present theperformance results of each implementation on different kinds ofheterogeneous hardware architecture.

Inparticular, in a time critical environment, temporal correlation ofstreaming sensor data should be monitored. A run-time monitor isembedded in the server for such applications, in order to detecterroneous conditions, and perform appropriate reactions in a timelymanner. However, modification of the monitor may require stop andrestart of the server, in order to take effect. This kind of option isnot permissible where the server should be performing continuously. Inthis paper, we propose a component based reconfigurable sensor networkmonitor designed for handling time critical requirements. In order toallow dynamic modification, we implement both the server and the monitoron the Fractal Component model, which enables us to reconfigure thesystem architecture in run-time. For detecting violation of the timingcondition, we specify timing constraints, and design the monitor onFractal Aspect Component. The architecture can be formally verified byFractal-ADL and Alloy. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposedframework, by developing a smart cruise control system. We aim toprovide guidance to construct a monitoring system in a dynamic and timecritical environment.

       "| Software Requirement Specification Based on a Gray Box for EmbeddedSystems: A Case Study of a Mobile Phone Camera Sensor Controller        | 10.3390/computers8010020     | 2019 | Software Requirement Specification Based on a Gray Box for EmbeddedSystems: A Case Study of a Mobile Phone Camera Sensor Controller One of the most widely used models for specifying functionalrequirements is a use case model. The viewpoint of the use case modelthat views a system as a black box focuses on descriptions of externalinteractions between the system and related environments. However, forembedded systems that do not disclose most implementation logics outsidethe system, black box-based use case models may experience the drawbackthat considerable information that must be defined for systemdevelopments is omitted. To solve this shortcoming, several studies havebeen proposed on the use of kind of white box technique in which thedynamic behaviors of embedded systems are defined first using a statediagram and the results are reflected in the requirement specifications.However, white box-based modeling has not been widely adopted bydevelopers due to tasks that require a lot of time in the requirementanalysis phase in the initial phase of the software development lifecycle. This study proposes a gray box-based requirement specificationmethod as a trade-off between two contradictory elements (the amount ofinformation required to develop an embedded system and the cost of theeffort required during the requirement analysis phase) in terms of thetwo approaches, the black and the white box-based models. The proposedmethod suggests that an appropriate depth level of embedded systemmodeling is required to define the requirements. This study alsoproposes a mechanism that automatically generates an applicationprogramming interface for each component based on the created model. Theproposed method was applied to the development of a camera sensorcontroller in a mobile phone, and the case results proved thefeasibility of the method through discussion of the application results. embedded system; automatic requirement specifications; state model;camera sensor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | embedded system  | embedded system  | embedded system |\n",

In this way it ispossible to investigate the effects of power converter faults inelectrical drives with the aim to propose solutions that allow to reducethe periods of drives inoperability. In this paper, a suitablerealization of a test bench combining an embedded system based on a FPGAboard with a high-level graphical programming language is proposed toreplace part of the electrical drive hardware. Differently than standardapproaches for FPGA programming, which are normally based on hardwaredescription languages, the proposed solution exploits an environmentsoftware platform with a high level of abstraction that leads to a goodtrade-off between accuracy and hardware resources, also allowing afaster prototyping procedure. The proposed HIL solution has been used tostudy some common faults occurring in power converters, evaluating thebehavior of a standard drive operating with different controlalgorithms.

The typical specialization process is based on a mixof precompiler macros and build scripts, both of which are known forbeing sources of errors.In this article, we present a new model-based approach to the design ofapplication-specific RTOS. Starting with finite state models describingthe RTOS and the application requirements, the set of blocks in the RTOScode actually used by the application is automatically computed. Thisset is used to build an application-specific RTOS model. This model isfed into a code generator to produce the source code of anapplication-specific RTOS. It is also used to carry on model-basedvalidations and verifications, including the formal verification thatthe specialization process did not introduce unwanted behaviors orsuppress expected ones.To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, it is applied tospecialize Trampoline, an open-source implementation of the AUTOSAR OSstandard, to an industrial case study from the automotive domain.

However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication. We present an algorithm that transforms component-baseddesign spaces, expressible in CoDeL, to an SMT program, which, solved bystate-of-the-art SMT solvers, determines the satisfiability of thesynthesis problem, and delivers a correct-by-construction systemconfiguration. Evaluation results for use cases in the domain ofscheduling and mapping of distributed real-time processes confirm,first, the performance gain of SMT compared to traditional design spaceexploration approaches, second, the usability gains by expressing designproblems in CoDeL, and third, the capability of the CoDeL/SMT approachto support the design of embedded systems.

       "| Automatic synthesis of communication and concurrency for exploringcomponent-based system implementations considering UML channel semantics | 10.1016/j.sysarc.2015.07.002 | 2015 | Automatic synthesis of communication and concurrency for exploringcomponent-based system implementations considering UML channel semantics Nowadays, multi-processor systems play a critical role in embeddedsystem engineering. As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess. To demonstrate these capabilities, the methodology is testedwith two large examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While technologyexists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-basedapplications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools.Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very fewexisting and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution todevelopers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integratedmodel-driven development environment that addresses all phases ofapplication lifecycle including design, development, verification,analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, withsupporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such amodel-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, thispaper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMSML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specificsub-languages. We claim that the language promotes``correct-by-construction{''} software development and integration bysupporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle. Using acase study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS ML impacts thedevelopment of embedded systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in {[}1]). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself. We first present a performance analysis ofdifferent JIT compilation technologies in order to identify hardware andsoftware optimization opportunities. Second, we propose a solution basedon a dedicated processor with specialized instructions for criticalfunctions of JIT compilers. These specialized instructions provide anaverage 5x speedup on manipulations of associative arrays and dynamicmemory allocation. Based on the LLVM framework, we show a 15\\% overallspeedup on code generator's execution time. Because our specializedinstructions are hidden behind standard libraries, we also argue thatthese instructions may be transparently reused for a wider range ofapplications.

These components need to interact in atimely fashion to achieve the system level end-to-end requirements. Inpractice, the component level timing specification consists of designattributes like component task mapping, task period and scheduledefinition but often lack details on their real-time (functional)requirements. As we observe, there is no systematic methodology in placefor decomposing the feature level timing requirements into componentlevel timing requirements. This paper proposes an early stagetime-budgeting methodology to bridge the above gap. A salient proposalof this methodology is to consider parameterized componenttiming-requirements. A key step in the methodology involves computing aset of constraints by relating component requirements with featurerequirements. This enables the separation of timing constraints fromfunctionality decomposition, and facilitates early optimization of thecomponent time-budget for a complex component based embedded system.This paper formalizes the proposed methodology by using ParametricTemporal Logic. A case study involving two advanced features from theautomotive domain, namely Adaptive Cruise Control and CollisionMitigation is given to demonstrate the methodology.

The control software adapts several control variables tokeep the operational state optimal with respect to multiple objectives.There exist well-known techniques for solving such optimizationproblems. However, current practice shows that the applied techniques,control variables, constraints and related design decisions are notdocumented as a part of the architecture description. Theirimplementation is implicit, tailored for specific characteristics of theembedded system, tightly integrated into and coupled with the controlsoftware, which hinders its reusability, analyzability andmaintainability. This paper presents an architectural framework todesign, document and realize multi-objective optimization in embeddedcontrol software. The framework comprises an architectural styletogether with its visual editor and domain-specific analysis tools, anda code generator.

To design a system whichmeets all its quality requirements becomes increasingly difficultbecause of customer demand for new innovative user functions. Methodsand tools are needed to assist the architect during system design.The goal of this paper is to show how metaheuristic optimizationapproaches can improve the process of designing efficient architecturesfor a set of given quality attributes. A case study is conducted inwhich an architecture optimization framework is applied to an existingsub-system in the automotive industry. The case study shows thatmetaheuristic optimization approaches can find efficient solutions forall quality attributes while fulfilling given constraints.By optimizing multiple quality attributes the framework proposesrevolutionary architecture solutions in contrast to human architects,who tend to propose solutions based on previous architectures. Althoughthe case study shows savings in manual effort, it also shows that theproposed architecture solutions should be assessed by the humanarchitect. So, the paper demonstrates how an architecture optimizationframework complements the domain knowledge and experience of thearchitect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

       "| Analysis of distributed multiperiodic systems to achieve consistent datamatching                                                           | 10.1002/cpe.2803             | 2013 | Analysis of distributed multiperiodic systems to achieve consistent datamatching The distributed real-time architecture of an embedded system is oftendescribed as a set of communicating components. Such a system isdataflow (for its description) and time triggered (for its execution).The architecture forms a graph of communicating components, where morethan one path can link two components. Because the characteristics ofthe network and the behavior of intermediate components may vary or areonly partially known, these paths often have different timingcharacteristics, and the flows of information that transit on thesepaths reach their destination at independent times. However, anapplication that seeks consistent values will require these flows to betemporally matched so that a component uses inputs that all (directly orindirectly) depend on the same computation step of another component. Inthis paper, we define this temporal data-matching property, both in astrict sense and in a relaxed way allowing approximately consistentvalues. Then, we show how to analyze a system architecture to detectsituations that result in data-matching inconsistencies. In the contextof multiperiodic systems, where components do not necessarily share acommon period, we also describe an approach to manage data matching thatuses queues to delay too fast paths and timestamps to recognizeconsistent data sets.

These new features needto be considered as early as possible in the software development lifecycle. Model driven engineering promotes an intensive use of models andis now widely seen as a solution to master the development of complexsystems such as embedded ones. Component-based software engineering isanother major trend that gains acceptance in the embedded world becauseof its properties such as reuse, modularity, and flexibility. Thisarticle proposes the Flex-eWare component model (FCM) for designing andimplementing modern embedded systems. The FCM unifies model drivenengineering and component-based software engineering and has beenevaluated in several application domains with different requirements:wireless sensor networks, distributed client/server applications, andcontrol systems for electrical devices. This approach highlights a newconcept: flexibility points that arise at several stages of thedevelopment process, that is, in the model (design phase), in theexecution platform, and during the execution itself. This flexibilitypoints are captured with model libraries that can extend the FCM.Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \\&amp; Sons, Ltd. embedded system; software component; flexibility; model drivenengineering                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | embedded system  | embedded system  | embedded system |\n",

Asthey integrate hard- and software elements, their functionality andreliability are often tested by hardware-in-the-loop methods, in whichthe system under test runs in a simulated environment. Due to the risingcomplexity of the embedded functions, performance limitations andpracticability reasons, the simulations are often specialized to testspecific aspects of the embedded system and develop a high diversity bythemselves. This diversity is difficult to manage for a user and resultsin erroneously selected test components and compatibility problems inthe test configuration. This paper presents a generative programmingapproach that handles the diversity of test libraries. Compatibilityissues are explicitly evaluated by a new interface concept. Furthermore,a novel model analyzer facilitates the efficient application in practiceby migrating existing libraries. The approach is evaluated for anexample from the automotive domain using MATLAB/Simulink. (C) 2010Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules. This yields an effective and cost-efficient approach tocompositional synchronous modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployedRemora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligibleCPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. wireless sensor networks; high-level programming; component model;event-driven                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | embedded systems | embedded systems | embedded system |\n",

To alleviate the burden on students in the roboticscurriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform onembedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has beendeveloped and fabricated as a supplement for these students. Thisgeneral-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial trainingkits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has beenbrought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and C/OS-II suchthat it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition tolinking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, userscan program the codes not only in C language, but also through visualprogramming by means of a graphic interface developed along with theplatform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot functiondesign. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping inrobotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated withthe platform has been designed and used in classes. Based on assessmentsand evaluation on the students who have completed this course, thecurricular training is satisfactory and largely meets the requirementsestablished at the design stage.

Nowadays, limited relatedworks have been proposed to address particular cases of reconfigurationswithout considering distributed architectures. Our first problem is tobe able to handle all possible forms of reconfigurations that can beapplied at run-time to distributed Function Blocks. In this case, acoordination between devices of the execution environment should beapplied to guarantee safe and coherent distributed reconfigurations. Asecond problem is to find the sufficient solutions for the correctimplementation of this reconfigurable distributed architecture.Objective: The paper defines an implementable multi-agent architecturefor automatic and coherent reconfigurations of distributed FunctionBlocks.Method: To address all possible industrial forms, we classify thereconfiguration scenarios into three levels. The first level deals withadditions-removals of Function Blocks to-from the system'simplementation. The second deals with updates of compositions of blocks,and the third deals with updates of data. We define a ReconfigurationAgent for each device of the execution environment, and a uniqueCoordination Agent for coordinations between devices. EachReconfiguration Agent to be modelled by nested state machines applieslocal reconfiguration scenarios in the corresponding device aftercoordinations with the Coordination Agent. We propose an Inter-AgentsCommunication Protocol to support correct and coherent reconfigurationsof distributed devices. This protocol is based on Coordination Matricesto be handled by the Coordination Agent in order to define allreconfiguration scenarios that should be simultaneously applied indistributed devices. We propose XML-based implementations for both kindsof agents where XML code blocks are exchanged between devices toguarantee safety distributed reconfigurations. The contributions of thepaper are applied to two Benchmark Production Systems available in ourresearch laboratory.Results: The communication protocol is successfully applied to ourplatforms where simulations are executed to check distributed andcoherent reconfiguration scenarios. The Reconfiguration and CoordinationAgents are implemented in this platform by following the InternationalStandard IEC61499. We show in addition XML-based successful interactionsbetween devices when distributed reconfigurations are applied.Conclusion: The paper successfully defines a multi-agent architecturefor IEC61499 distributed reconfigurable embedded systems whereCoordination and Reconfiguration agents are proposed to allow feasibleand coherent distributed reconfigurations by using a definedcommunication protocol. This architecture is implemented in XML andapplied to real industrial platforms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Although there havebeen pioneering efforts in applying componentization tosystems-building, these efforts have tended to target specificapplication domains (e. g., embedded systems, operating systems,communications systems, programmable networking environments, ormiddleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantageof this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity andabstraction potential of the component approach. In this article, weargue for the benefits and feasibility of a generic yet tailorableapproach to component-based systems-building that offers a uniformprogramming model that is applicable in a wide range of systems-orientedtarget domains and deployment environments.

Embeddedsystems are pervasive and often mission-critical, therefore, they mustbe highly trustworthy. Trustworthy embedded systems require extensiveverification. The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions ofbottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verificationcomplexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verificationreuse. Case studies on a suite of networked sensors have shown that ourapproach facilitates major verification reuse and leads toorder-of-magnitude reduction on verification complexity.

At the same time,microkernel-based operating systems are being used to increase thereliability and trustworthiness of embedded systems. Since themicrokernel approach to designing systems is partially based on thecomponentisation of system services, component-based softwareengineering is a particularly attractive approach to developingmicrokernel-based systems. While a number of widely used componentarchitectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprisecomputing rather than embedded systems. Due to the uniquecharacteristics of embedded systems, a component architecture forembedded systems must have low overhead, be able to address relevantnon-functional issues, and be flexible to accommodate applicationspecific requirements. In this paper we introduce a componentarchitecture aimed at the development of microkernel-based embeddedsystems. The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible. We have implemented a prototype of this architecture andconfirm that it has very low overhead and is suitable for implementingboth system-level and application level services.

At the same time, the systemsmust fulfill strict requirements on reliability and correctness.This paper proposes a formal verification methodology which smoothlyintegrates with component-based system-level design using a divide andconquer approach. The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component. Themethodology verifies the correctness of the glue logic inserted betweenthe components and the interaction of the components through the gluelogic. Each such glue logic is verified one at a time using modelchecking techniques.Experimental results have shown the efficiency of the proposedmethodology and demonstrated that it is feasible to apply such averification methodology on real-life examples. formal verification; petri-nets; components; iP; model checking;embedded systems; real-time systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Embedded systems | embedded systems | embedded system |\n",

Developers want to maximizethe use of the limited resources available on the device while still notexceeding the capabilities of the device. To do this, the developer mustbe able to scale his software for different platforms. In this paper, wepresent a software engineering methodology that automatically scalessoftware to different platforms. We intend to have the applicationdeveloper write high level functional specifications of his software andhave tools that automatically scale the underlying runtime. These toolswill use the functional and non-functional constraints of both thehardware and client application to produce an appropriate runtime. Ourinitial results show that the proposed approach can scale operatingsystems and virtual machines that satisfy the constraints of varyinghardware/application combinations. design; performance; languages; embedded systems; runtime systems;components; constraints; wireless sensor networks; generativeprogramming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | embedded systems | embedded systems | embedded system |\n",

Component middleware,however, also introduces challenges for DRE system developers, such asevaluating the predictability of DRE system behavior, and choosing theright design alternatives before committing to a specific platform orplatform configuration. Model-based technologies help address theseissues by enabling design-time analysis, and providing the means toautomate the development, deployment, configuration, and integration ofcomponent-based DRE systems. To this end, this paper applies modelchecking techniques to DRE design models using model transformations toverify key QoS properties of component-based DRE systems developed usingReal-time CORBA. We introduce a formal semantic domain for a generalclass of DRE systems that enables the verification of distributednon-preemptive real-time scheduling. Our results show that model-basedtechniques enable design-time analysis of timed properties and can beapplied to effectively predict, simulate, and verify the event-drivenbehavior of component-based DRE systems. schedulability analysis; model checking; component middleware;distributed real-time; embedded systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | embedded systems | embedded systems | embedded system |\n",

However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints. We use amulti-objective concept to model the composition analysis problem anduse an evolutionary algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal solutionsefficiently. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem. We bring forth anumber of issues related to the automation of reusable IP compositionincluding type- compatibility checking, split-programming, andintrospective composition environment, and demonstrate their utilitythrough design examples. hardware/software co-design; system-on-chip; embedded systems; hardwaredescription language (HDL); modeling; simulation; design reuse;interface design                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | embedded systems | embedded systems | embedded system |\n",

My aim is to provide an efficient,lightweight code generation scheme suitable for resource constrainedmicrocontrollers.I describe an initial implementation of SCOPE-a hierarchical codegenerator for a variant of the statechart language. I shall discussseveral techniques implemented in the tool, namely imposing andexploiting a regular hierarchy structure, labeling schemes for fastancestor queries, improvements in exiting states, compile-time scoperesolution for transitions, and various details of compact runtimerepresentation.The resulting algorithm avoids the exponential code growth exhibited bytools based on flattening of hierarchical state machine. At the sametime it demonstrates that it is possible to maintain reasonable speedand size results even for small models, while preserving the hierarchyat runtime. SCOPE currently produces code that is comparable with thatof industrial tools (IAR visualSTATE) for small models and clearly winsfor bigger ones. algorithms; performance; program synthesis; automatic code generation;statecharts; embedded systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | embedded systems | embedded systems | embedded system |\n",

This paper argues thatmodeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyzeinteractions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a morestructured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity,to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semanticframework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses theissues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desirefor component reuse. It introduces the notion of domain polymorphism asa way to address these issues. component-based design; embedded systems; heterogeneous modeling; modelsof computation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | embedded systems | embedded systems | embedded system |\n",

       "| Code generator for implementing dual tree complex wavelet transform onreconfigurable architectures for mobile applications    | 10.1049/htl.2016.0034        | 2016 | Code generator for implementing dual tree complex wavelet transform onreconfigurable architectures for mobile applications The authors aimed to develop an application for producing differentarchitectures to implement dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT)having near shift-invariance property. To obtain a low-cost and portablesolution for implementing the DTCWT in multi-channel real-timeapplications, various embedded-system approaches are realised. Forcomparison, the DTCWT was implemented in C language on a personalcomputer and on a PIC microcontroller. However, in the former approachportability and in the latter desired speed performance propertiescannot be achieved. Hence, implementation of the DTCWT on areconfigurable platform such as field programmable gate array, whichprovides portable, low-cost, low-power, and high-performance computing,is considered as the most feasible solution. At first, they used thesystem generator DSP design tool of Xilinx for algorithm design.However, the design implemented by using such tools is not optimised interms of area and power. To overcome all these drawbacks mentionedabove, they implemented the DTCWT algorithm by using Verilog HardwareDescription Language, which has its own difficulties. To overcome thesedifficulties, simplify the usage of proposed algorithms and theadaptation procedures, a code generator program that can producedifferent architectures is proposed.

In this way, properties that can only beroughly estimated statically are evaluated against observed values andthis consequently allows to refine the design models for ensuringpreservation of analysed extra-functional properties at code level.Method: Following the model-driven engineering vision, (meta-) modelsand transformations are used as main artefacts for the realisation ofthe round-trip support which is finally validated against an industrialcase study.Result: This article presents an approach to support the wholeround-trip process starting from the generation of source code for atarget platform, passing through the monitoring of selected systemquality attributes at code level, and finishing with theback-propagation of observed values to modelling level. The technique isvalidated against an industrial case study in the telecommunicationsapplicative domain.Conclusion: Preservation of extra-functional properties throughappropriate description, computation and evaluation makes it possible toreduce final product verification and validation effort and costs bygenerating correct-by-construction code. The proposed round-trip supportaids a model-driven component-based development process in ensuring adesired level of extra-functional properties preservation from thesource modelling artefacts to the generated code.

The current implementation targets problem families that can betransformed, using disciplined convex programming techniques, to convexquadratic programs of modest size. CVXGEN generates simple, flat,library-free code suitable for embedding in real-time applications. Thegenerated code is almost branch free, and so has highly predictablerun-time behavior. The combination of regularization (both static anddynamic) and iterative refinement in the search direction computationyields reliable performance, even with poor quality data. In this paperwe describe how CVXGEN is implemented, and give some results on thespeed and reliability of the automatically generated solvers.

SR models allowto formally verify the correctness of the design and automaticallygenerate the implementation code. This feature is a major productivityenhancement and, more importantly, can ensure correct-by-design softwareprovided that the code generator is provably correct. This paperpresents an improvement of code generation technology for SR obtainedvia a novel algorithm for optimizing the multitask implementation ofSimulink models on single-processor platforms with limited availabilityof memory. Existing code generation tools require the addition ofzero-order hold (ZOH) blocks, and therefore additional memory, andpossibly also additional functional delays whenever there is a ratetransition in the computation and communication flow. Our algorithmleverages a novel efficient encoding of the scheduling feasibilityregion to find the task implementation of function blocks with minimumadditional functional delays within timing and memory constraints. Thealgorithm is applied to an automotive case study with tens of functionblocks and very high utilization to test its applicability to complexsystems.

Component reuse is based on a formal unified modelinglanguage (UML) real-time embedded object model. Formal synthesis employsquasi-static and quasi-dynamic scheduling with multi-layer portableefficient code generation, which can output either real-time operatingsystems (RTOS)-specific application code or automatically generatedreal-time executive with application code. Formal verificationintegrates a model checker kernel from state graph manipulators (SGM),by adapting it for embedded software. The proposed architecture forVERTAF is component-based which allows plug-and-play for the schedulerand the verifier. The architecture is also easily extensible becausereusable hardware and software design components can be added.Application examples developed using VERTAF demonstrate significantlyreduced relative design effort as compared to design without VERTAF,which also shows how high-level reuse of software components combinedwith automatic synthesis and verification increases design productivity.(C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, as the complexity of embedded systemsincreases, software programming on an increasing number ofmultiprocessors faces several critical problems, such as multithreadedcode generation, heterogeneous architecture adaptation, short designtime, and low cost implementation. In this paper, we present a softwarecode generation flow based on Simulink to address these problems. Wepropose a functional modeling style to capture data-intensive andcontrol-dependent target applications, and a system architecturemodeling style to seamlessly transform the functional model into thetarget architecture. Both models are described using Simulink. From asystem architecture Simulink model, a code generator produces amultithreaded code, inserting thread and communication primitives toabstract the heterogeneity of the target architecture. In addition, themultithread code generator called LESCEA applies the extensions ofdataflow based memory optimization techniques, considering both data andcontrol dependency. Experimental results on a Motion-JPEG decoder and anH.264 decoder show that the proposed multithread code generator enableseasy software programming on different multiprocessor architectures withsubstantially reduced data memory size (up to 68.0\\%) and code memorysize (up to 15.9\\%). multithreaded code generation; memory size reduction; multiprocessorSoC; Simulink                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | code generator  | code generator  | code gener |\n",

Wedescribe an implemented technique for producing optimizing compilers forDSELs, based on Kamin's idea of DSELs for program generation. Thetechnique uses a data type of syntax for basic types, a set of smartconstructors that perform rewriting over those types, some code motiontransformations, and a back-end code generator. Domain-specificoptimization results from chains of domain-independent rewrites on basictypes. New DSELs are defined directly in terms of the basic syntactictypes, plus host language functions and tuples. This definition stylemakes compilers easy to write and, in fact, almost identical to thesimplest embedded interpreters.

Unfortunately however, thereported level of adoption has been comparatively low. Where successeswere had, they were largely facilitated by the manifest endorsement,where not the mandate, by relevant stakeholders, either internal to theindustrial adopter or with authority over the application domain. Thework presented in this paper stems from a comprehensive initiative takenby the European Space Agency (ESA) and its industrial suppliers. Thisinitiative also enjoyed significant synergy with interests shown forsimilar goals by the telecommunications and railways domain, thanks tothe interaction between two parallel project frameworks. The ESA effortaimed at favouring the adoption of a software reference architectureacross its software supply chain. The center of that strategy revolvesaround a component model and the software development process thatbuilds on it.

The methodology relies on RT-CCM (Real-timeContainer Component Model), a component technology aimed to make thetiming behaviour of the applications predictable and inspired in theLightweight CCM specification of the OMG. Some new mechanisms have beenintroduced in the underlying framework that make it possible to schedulethe execution of code and the transmission of messages of an applicationwhile guaranteeing that the application will meet its timingrequirements when executed. The added mechanisms also enable theapplication designer to configure this scheduling without interferingwith the opacity typically required in component management. Moreover,the methodology includes a process for generating the real-time model ofa component-based application as a composition of the reusable real-timemodels of the components that form it. From the analysis of this modelthe application designer obtains the configuration values that must beapplied to the component instances and the elements of the framework inorder to make the application fulfil its timing requirements.

Because of the difficulty increating these systems and the consequences of failure, they requirerigorous and reliable design approaches. The synchronous approach is onepossible answer to this demand. Its mathematical basis provides formalconcepts that favor the trusted design of embedded real-time systems.The multiclock or polychronous model stands out from other synchronousspecification models by its capability to enable the design of systemswhere each component holds its own activation clock as well assingle-clocked systems in a uniform way. A great advantage is itsconvenience for component-based design approaches that enable modulardevelopment of increasingly complex modern systems. The expressivenessof its underlying semantics allows dealing with several issues ofreal-time design. This article exposes insights gained during recentyears from the design of real-time applications within the polychronousframework. In particular, it shows promising results about the design ofapplications from the avionics domain. design; languages; verification; synchronous approach; avionics; SIGNAL;IMA | real-time systems | real-time systems | real-time system |\n",

TURTLE relies on UML's extensibility mechanisms to enhanceclass and activity diagrams. Class diagrams are extended withspecialized classes named Tclasses, which communicate and synchronizethrough gates. Also, associations between Tclasses are attributed by acomposition operator (Parallel, Synchro, Invocation, Sequence, orPreemption) which provides them with a formal semantics. TURTLE extendsUML activity diagrams with synchronization actions and temporaloperators ( deterministic delay, nondeterministic delay, time-limitedoffer, and time-capture). The real-time dimension of TURTLE has beenfurther improved by the addition of two composition operators, Periodicand Suspend, as well as suspendable delay, latency, and time-limitedoffer operators at the activity diagram level. Core characteristics ofTURLE are supported by TTool-the TURTLE toolkit-which includes a diagrameditor, a RT-LOTOS code generator and a result analyzer. The toolkitreuses RTL, a RT-LOTOS validation tool offering debug-orientedsimulation and exhaustive analysis. TTool hides RT-LOTOS to the end-userand allows him/her to directly check TURTLE modeling against logicalerrors and timing inconsistencies. Besides the foundations of the TURTLEprofile, this paper also discusses its application in the context ofspace-based embedded software. real-time systems; UML; RT-LOTOS; formal validation                                                                                                                                             | real-time systems | real-time systems | real-time system |\n",

Manyrange-based localization algorithms have been proposed for 2-D sensornetworks or densely deployed 3-D sensor networks. However, range-basedlocalization in sparse 3-D sensor networks is still a challengingproblem, because the sparseness of the network makes it difficult toobtain a proper order of nodes to be sequentially localized. Thepatch-and-stitching localization strategy can conquer the sparsenessproblem in 2-D networks, but for 3-D networks it is still unknown how touniquely merge two patches when there are not enough common nodes. Inthis paper, we solve this challenging problem by deriving the conditionsunder which two subnetworks can be uniquely merged. In the proposedapproach, we treat the translation parameters as unknowns and form a setof equations with which the unknowns can be uniquely solved. The noveltyof our algorithm also lies in that we exploit both common nodes andconnecting edges among adjacent subnetworks to merge them, resulting invery high chances that two subnetworks can be merged. We conductextensive simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of theproposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm couldlocalize more than 90\\% of nodes in sparse 3-D networks with averagenode degree of 11 and anchor ratio of 5\\%, while the best existingsolution can localize only 52\\% of nodes in the same situation.

PROVIZ is an integrated visualization and programming frameworkwith the following features: PROVIZ includes (1) a visualization toolthat can visualize heterogeneous WSN traffic (with different packetpayload formats) by parsing the data received either from a packetsniffer (e.g., a sensor-based sniffer or a commercial TI SmartRF802.15.4 packet sniffer) or from a simulator (e.g., OMNeT); (2) ascripting language based on the TinyOS sensor network platform that aimsat reducing code size and improving programming efficacy; (3) anover-the-air programming tool to securely program sensor nodes; (4) avisual programming tool with basic sensor drag-and-drop modules forgenerating simple WSN programs; and (5) a visual network comparison toolthat analyzes packet traces of two networks to generate a juxtaposedvisual comparison of contrasting network characteristics. PROVIZ alsoincludes built-in extensible visual demo deployment capabilities thatallow users to quickly craft network scenarios and share them with otherusers. In this work, we introduce the various features of PROVIZ'svisualization and programming framework, analyze test scenarios, anddiscuss how all the tools can be used in sync with each other to createan all-encompassing development and test environment.

In recent years,range-free localization algorithms have drawn much research attentiondue to their low cost and applicability to large-scale WSNs. However,the application of range-free localization algorithms is restrictedbecause of their dramatic accuracy degradation in practical anisotropicWSNs, which is mainly caused by large error of distance estimation.Distance estimation in the existing range-free algorithms usually relieson a unified per hop length (PHL) metric between nodes. But the PHLbetween different nodes might be greatly different in anisotropic WSNs,resulting in large error in distance estimation. We find that, althoughthe PHL between different nodes might be greatly different, it exhibitssignificant locality; that is, nearby nodes share a similar PHL toanchors that know their positions in advance. Based on the locality ofthe PHL, a novel distance estimation approach is proposed in thisarticle. Theoretical analyses show that the error of distance estimationin the proposed approach is only one-fourth of that in thestate-of-the-art pattern-driven scheme (PDS). An anchor selectionalgorithm is also devised to further improve localization accuracy bymitigating the negative effects from the anchors that are poorlydistributed in geometry. By combining the locality-based distanceestimation and the anchor selection, a range-free localization algorithmnamed Selective Multilateration (SM) is proposed. Simulation resultsdemonstrate that SM achieves localization accuracy higher than 0.3r,where r is the communication radius of nodes. Compared to thestate-of-the-art solution, SM improves the distance estimation accuracyby up to 57\\% and improves localization accuracy by up to 52\\%consequently.

Although manylocalization algorithms have been proposed in recent years, they usuallytarget at dense networks and perform poorly in sparse networks. In thispaper, we propose two component-based localization algorithms that canlocalize many more nodes in sparse networks than the state-of-the-artsolution. We first develop the Basic Common nodes-based LocalizationAlgorithm, namely BCLA, which uses both common nodes and measureddistances between adjacent components to merge components. BCLAoutperforms CALL, the state-of-the-art component-based localizationalgorithm that uses only distance measurements to merge components. Inorder to further improve the performance of BCLA, we further exploit theangular information among nodes to merge components, and propose theComponent-based Localization with Angle and Distance informationalgorithm, namely CLAD. We prove the merging conditions for BCLA andCLAD, and evaluate their performance through extensive simulations.Simulations results show that, CLAD can locate more than 90 percent ofnodes in a sparse network with average node degree 7.5, while CALL canlocate only 78 percent of nodes in the same scenario.

However, the dynamic profiling must be able toaccurately capture application behavior without incurring significantruntime overheads. Since application-and sensor-specific constraintsdictate the profiling requirements and tolerated overheads, designersrequire design assistance to quickly evaluate and select appropriateprofiling methodologies. To increase designer productivity, we formulateprofiling methodology design guidelines based on extensive evaluationand analysis of a variety of profiling methodologies suitable fordynamically monitoring WSNs with respect to network traffic overhead,power, and code impacts associated with each method. While energyconsumption increases are reasonable, ranging from 0.5\\% to 2.6\\%,network traffic, code size, and computation time overheads can be ashigh as 66.2\\%, 75.9\\%, and 136.6\\%, respectively. Our results show thatthese overhead variations are highly application specific, and a singleprofiling method is not suitable for all types of application behavior,thus necessitating, application-specific profiling methodologycustomization. To facilitate rapid development of these profilingmethodologies, we present a profiler-customization methodologyconsisting of a code generator module, overhead estimation module, andprofile data management module. Using our profiling-customizationmethodology, designers can rapidly evaluate the overhead of differentprofiling methodologies, and automatically integrate the mostappropriate methodology into the application at design time.

Standard design and development techniques often fail toeffectively manage the complexity and dynamics of such systems. As aresult, there is a strong need for new programing models andabstractions. Towards this, component-based design methods are apromising solution. However, existing such approaches either do notaccurately model transitory interactions between components - which aretypical of cyber-physical systems - or do not provide guarantees forreal-time behavior which is essential in safety-critical applications.To overcome this problem, we present a component-based design techniquebased on DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components). The DEECoframework allows modeling large-scale dynamic systems by a set ofinteracting components and, in contrast to approaches from theliterature, it provides mechanisms to describe transitory interactionsbetween them. To allow reasoning about timing behavior at thecomponent-description level, we characterize DEECo's closed-loop delayin the worst case, i.e., the maximum time needed to react to a change inthe environment. Based on this, we incorporate real-time analysis intoDEECo's design flow. This further allows us to analyze the system'srobustness under unreliable communication and to design decentralizedsafety-preserving mechanisms. To illustrate the simplicity andusefulness of our approach, we present a case study consisting of anintelligent crossroad system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Albany usestemplate-based generic programming methods to provide extensibility andflexibility; it employs a generic residual evaluation interface tosupport the easy addition and modification of physics. This interface iscoupled to powerful automatic differentiation utilities that are used toimplement efficient nonlinear solvers and preconditioners, and also toenable sensitivity analysis and embedded uncertainty quantificationcapabilities as part of the forward solve. The flexible applicationprogramming interfaces in Albany couple to two different adaptive meshlibraries; it internally employs generic integration machinery thatsupports tetrahedral, hexahedral, and hybrid meshes of user specifiedorder. We present the overall design of Albany, and focus on thespecifics of the integration of many of its advanced features. As Albanyand the components that form it are openly available on the internet, itis our goal that the reader might find some of the design conceptsuseful in their own work. Albany results in a code that enables therapid development of parallel, numerically efficient multiphysicssoftware tools.

This paper presents SBIP, an extension of BIP for stochasticsystems. SBIP offers the possibility to add stochastic information toatomic component's behaviors, and hence to the entire system. Atomiccomponent's semantics in SBIP is described by Markov Chains. We showthat the semantics of the entire system is described by a Markov chain,showing that the non-determinism arising from system interactions isautomatically eliminated by BIP.

However, many applications-particularlyembedded systems-consist of not only software, but also hardwarecomponents. Thus, component-based design should be extended to systemswith both hardware and software components.Such an extension is not without challenges though. The extendedmethodology has to consider hard constraints on performance as well asdifferent cost factors. Also, the dissimilarities between hardware andsoftware (such as level of abstraction, communication primitives, etc.)have to be resolved.In this paper, the authors propose such an extended component-baseddesign methodology to include hardware components as well. Thismethodology allows the designer to work at a very high level ofabstraction, where the focus is on functionality only. Non-functionalconstraints are specified in a declarative manner, and the mapping ofcomponents to hardware or software is determined automatically based onthose constraints in the so-called hardware/software partitioning step.Moreover, a tool is presented supporting the new design methodology.Beside automating the partitioning process, this tool also checks theconsistency between hardware and software implementations of acomponent. component-based design; hardware/software co-design; hardware/softwarepartitioning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | component-based design | component-based design | component-based design |\n",

Then, a component-based design is performed. At softwaredesign time, software components yield embedded system functionality,and they also model hardware and mechanics functionality.

Thenature of such systems is highly dynamic and very heterogeneous andissues such as interoperability, energy consumption, or resourcemanagement must be properly managed to ensure the operation of theapplications within the required quality of service level. In thiscontext, base technologies such as component based software engineeringor Service Oriented Architecture can play a central role. Model drivendevelopment and middleware technologies also aid in the design,development, and operation of such systems. This paper presents amiddleware solution that provides runtime support for the completelifecycle management of a system consisting of several concurrentapplications running over a set of distributed infrastructure nodes. Themiddleware builds up on top of a general purpose component model and isdriven by a quality of service aware self-configuration algorithm thatprovides stateful reconfiguration capabilities in face of both internal(application triggered) and external (application unaware)reconfiguration events. The platform has been deployed over an automatedwarehouse supervision system that serves as a case study. NA | case study   | case study   | case studi |\n",

A common approach to reducing softwarecomplexity is to partition system behavior into different operationalmodes. Such a multi-mode system can change its behavior by switchingbetween modes under certain circumstances. Another approach tosimplifying software development is Component-Based SoftwareEngineering, which allows a system to be developed by reusablecomponents. Combining both approaches, we get component-baseddevelopment of multi-mode systems, for which a key issue is the modeswitch handling. Since most existing mode switch techniques do notconsider component-based systems, we present in this article anapproach-the Mode Switch Logic (MSL)-for the development ofcomponent-based multi-mode systems. Additionally, we provide a timinganalysis for the mode switch of systems using our MSL. Finally, thefundamentals of MSL and its mode switch timing analysis are demonstratedand evaluated by a case study, an Adaptive Cruise Control system. (C)2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition, theemergence of new software technologies has required these applicationsto meet the needs of heterogeneous software platforms. However, theexisting approaches to build fault-tolerant systems are often targetedat a particular platform and software technology. The objective of thispaper is to discuss the use of FlexFT-a generic component-basedframework for the construction of adaptive fault-tolerant systems thatcan integrate and reuse technologies and deploy them acrossheterogeneous devices. Furthermore, FlexFT provides a standardized andinteroperable interface for sensor observations by relying upon the``Sensor Web{''} paradigm established by the Open Geospatial Consortium(OGC). We have implemented a Java prototype of our framework andevaluated the potential benefits by carrying out case studies andperformance measurements. By implementing and deploying these casestudies in standard PCs as well as in sensor nodes, we show that FlexFTcan cope with the problem of a wide degree of heterogeneity with minimalresource overheads.

Component-based software engineering proved to be a promisingsolution for managing software complexity and allowing for reuse.However, there are several challenges inherent in the intersection ofresource efficiency and predictability of multi-core processors when itcomes to running component-based embedded software. In this paper, wepresent a software design framework addressing these challenges. Theframework includes both mapping of software components onto executabletasks, and the partitioning of the generated task set onto the cores ofa multi-core processor. This paper aims at enhancing resource efficiencyby optimizing the software design with respect to: 1) the inter-softwarecomponents communication cost, 2) the cost of synchronization amongdependent transactions of software components, and 3) the interaction ofsoftware components with the basic software services. An enginemanagement system, one of the most complex automotive sub-systems, isconsidered as a use case, and the experimental results show a reductionof up to 11.2\\% total CPU usage on a quad-core processor, in comparisonwith the common framework in the literature.

To understand or validate the behavior of such a system,one needs to understand the components involved in combination withunderstanding how they are configured and composed. This becomesincreasingly difficult when components are implemented in variousprogramming languages, and composition is specified in externalartifacts. Moreover, tooling that supports in-depth system-wide analysisof such heterogeneous systems is lacking.Objective: This paper contributes a method to analyze and visualizeinformation flow in a component based system at various levels ofabstraction. These visualizations are designed to support thecomprehension needs of both safety domain experts and softwaredevelopers for, respectively, certification and evolution ofsafety-critical cyber-physical systems.Method: We build system-wide dependence graphs and use static programslicing to determine all possible end-to-end information flows throughand across a system's components. We define a hierarchy of fiveabstractions over these information flows that reduce visual distractionand cognitive overload, while satisfying the users' information needs.We improve on our earlier work to provide interconnected views thatsupport both systematic, as well as opportunistic navigation scenarios.Results: We discuss the design and implementation of our approach andthe resulting views in a prototype tool called FlowTracker. We summarizethe results of a qualitative evaluation study, carried out via tworounds of interview, on the effectiveness and usability of these views.We discuss a number of improvements, such as more selective informationpresentations, that resulted from the evaluation.Conclusion: The evaluation shows that the proposed approach and viewsare useful for understanding and validating heterogeneouscomponent-based systems, and address information needs that couldearlier only be met by manual inspection of the source code.

The proposed solutionallows modelling and analysing component-based embedded softwareapplications that are defined using a specific pattern in which eachcomponent is executed by a task with a specific priority. Theinfrastructure is also capable of analysing the system performance whenthe tasks access shared resources, using either immediate priorityceiling, or priority inheritance protocols, in order to avoid thepriority inversion problem. The paper shows the set of rules that enablethe transformation between an application, compliant with the proposeddesign pattern, and its corresponding PCM.

The adoption of a sound software architecture provides crucial aid in conveniently apportioning the relevantdevelopment concerns. This paper takes a software-centeredinterpretation of the ISO 42010 notion of architecture, enhancing itwith a component model that attributes separate concerns to distinctdesign views. The component boundary becomes the border betweenfunctional and extrafunctional concerns. The latter are treated asdecorations placed on the outside of components, satisfied byimplementation artifacts separate from and composable with theimplementation of the component internals. The approach was evaluated byindustrial users from several domains, with remarkably positive results.(C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The protocol conformancechecking problem consists of determining whether the actual behavior ofa component conforms to the protocol specifications on its ports. Inthis paper, we consider this problem in the context of the model-drivendevelopment (MDD) of embedded systems based on UML 2, in which UML 2state machines are used to specify component behavior. We provide adefinition of conformance which slightly extends those found in theliterature and reduce the conformance check to a state spaceexploration. We describe a tool implementing the approach using the JavaPathFinder software model checker and the MDD tool IBM Rational RoseRT,discuss its application to three case studies, and show how the toolrepeatedly allowed us to find unexpected conformance errors withencouraging performance.

One example is theVehicle Information System (VIS), in which several components gathervehicle information such as RPM and fuel tank level, and are tightlycoupled with the embedded hardware. Several projects have been startedby commercial software companies or passionate open source developers tomeet the needs for entertainment, gathering vehicle information, andtraffic information in vehicle. We design and implement a softwareintegration framework for such systems and a vehicle safety boxcomponent for VIS. The framework allows the users and developers tointegrate independently developed software components into one systemand provides a unified GUI In addition, it eliminates the efforts forre-designing or re-compiling the system for software upgrades. component-based software engineering; user interface; framework;software reliability; UML; ITS; GPS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | component-based software engineering | component-based software engineering | component-based software engin |\n",

So, component models are adaptedtrying to minimize conflicts integrating real-time and dynamicbehaviors, and achieving components replacements in a bounded time. Oneof the main challenges for this is to calculate the required times bythe different operations needed in a component replacement. The otherissue is to know the operating times of the component in the system whentheir implementations change along the life of the system. In this workthe implementation of a component framework implementation is describedproviding a partial solution for these problems. A component model isprovided together with the corresponding algorithms to assure thatcomponents can be loaded and replaced at run-time without interfering intheir execution deadlines. The model is designed to avoid failuresduring component replacements. Finally a validation of the presentedconcepts is provided.

       "| An extensible framework for software configuration optimization onheterogeneous computing systems: Time and energy case study | 10.1016/j.infsof.2018.08.003 | 2019 | An extensible framework for software configuration optimization onheterogeneous computing systems: Time and energy case study Context Application of component based software engineering methods toheterogeneous computing (HC) enables different software configurationsto realize the same function with different non-functional properties(NFP). Finding the best software configuration with respect to multipleNFPs is a non-trivial task.Objective: We propose a Software Component Allocation Framework (SCAF)with the goal to acquire a (sub-) optimal software configuration withrespect to multiple NFPs, thus providing performance prediction of asoftware configuration in its early design phase. We focus on thesoftware configuration optimization for the average energy consumptionand average execution time.Method: We validated SCAF through its instantiation on a real-worlddemonstrator and a simulation. Firstly, we verified the correctness ofour model through comparing the performance prediction of six softwareconfigurations to the actual performance, obtained through extensivemeasurements with a confidence interval of 95\\%. Secondly, todemonstrate how SCAF scales up, we performed software configurationoptimization on 55 generated use-cases (with solution spaces rangingfrom 10(30) to 30(70)) and benchmark the results against best performingrandom configurations.Results: The performance of a configuration as predicted by ourframework matched the configuration implemented and measured on areal-world platform. Furthermore, by applying the genetic algorithm andsimulated annealing to the weight function given in SCAF, we obtainsub-optimal software configurations differing in performance at most 7\\%and 13\\% from the optimal configuration (respectfully).Conclusion: SCAF is capable of correctly describing a HC platform andreliably predict the performance of software configuration in the earlydesign phase. Automated in the form of an Eclipse plugin, SCAF allowssoftware architects to model architectural constraints and preferences,acting as a multi-criterion software architecture decision supportsystem. In addition to said, we also point out several interestingresearch directions, to further investigate and improve our approach.

Its component-based meta-model enables the hierarchicalcomposition of processes and process variants. Domain-specific typingand polymorphism leverage the flexibility of processes by enabling thedynamic selection of process components.

Most of thehigh-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such asthe universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse widthmodulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers,and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems suchas Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuringperipherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configurethe same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverseopen-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programmingthose platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, wepropose an easy and convenient way to program and configure theoperation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based softwareframework.

In this context,it is hard to build confidence that a design solution fulfills theapplication's requirements. This paper introduces a design flow for webservice applications of the representational state transfer style thatis based on a formal modeling language, the behaviour, interaction,priority (BIP) component framework. The proposed flow applies theprinciples of separation of concerns in a component-based design processthat supports the modular design and reuse of model artifacts. The BIPtools for state-space exploration allow verifying qualitative propertiesfor service responsiveness, ie, the timely handling of events. Moreover,essential quantitative properties are validated through statisticalmodel checking of a stochastic BIP model. All properties are preservedin actual implementation by ensuring that the deployed code isconsistent with the validated model. We illustrate the design of arepresentational state transfer sense-compute-control application for aWireless Personal Area Network architecture with nodes running theContiki operating system. The results validate qualitative andquantitative properties for the system and include the study of errorbehaviours.

This paper presents a brief overview on these efforts and aninitiative to promote the Internet of Things by proposing an intuitivelow-cost prototyping platform based on recycled electronics. Theproposed solution is composed of a recycled smartphone and IOIO board,the latter gives to the smartphone the capability to be interconnectedwith hardware modules and sensors.

We presenta service composition system that enables the goal-driven configurationof smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata andreasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-drivenapproaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use ofembedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups thatfulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its highdegree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamicenvironments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual servicesbecoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, weintegrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows tomodel the desired state of a smart environment graphically, therebyhiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possibleapplications of the presented system include the management of smarthomes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smartenvironments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcaredomains.Note to Practitioners-Machine tooling times are an important factorespecially when producing small batch sizes. Our approach holds thepotential to have manufacturing lines reconfigure themselves at runtime,based on descriptions of the functionality of individual devices. It caneven consider properties that influence the process indirectly({''}nonfunctional{''}), such as the time or monetary cost of a process.We additionally implemented a system that makes these rather complexdescriptions understandable for nonspecialists.

We define a new semantics ofreconfigurations that allow automatic improvements of systemperformances at run-time even if there are no hardware faults. We applythis new semantics on two Benchmark Production Systems developed in ourresearch laboratory according to this industrial technology. We classifythereafter into three forms all possible reconfiguration scenarios to beapplied at run-time by a well-defined agent in order to adapt the systemto its environment according to well-defined conditions. The agent ismodelled by nested state machines according to the formalism NetCondition/Event Systems (NCES) which is an extension of Petri nets. Inorder to satisfy user requirements, we specify functional andnon-functional properties according to the well-known temporal logic``Computation Tree Logic{''} (CTL) as well as its extensions eCTL andTCTL, and we apply the model checker SESA to check the whole agent-basedarchitecture of the reconfigurable system.

The software framework is builtwith software components, based on a component-based concept withreference to a product lifecycle information acquisition and managementmodel proposed within this research study. Two actual lifecycleinformation management systems are created using the Framework in fieldtrials.

In addition tosupporting the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of individual DREsystems, component technologies must also support bounded latencies wheneffecting deployment changes to DRE systems in response to changingenvironmental conditions and operational requirements.Objective: The goals of this paper are to (1) study sources ofinefficiencies and non-deterministic performance in deploymentcapabilities for DRE systems and (2) devise solutions to overcome theseperformance problems.Method: The paper makes two contributions to the study of the deploymentand configuration of distributed component based applications. First, weanalyze how conventional implementations of the OMG's Deployment andConfiguration (D\\&amp;C) specification for component-based systems cansignificantly degrade deployment latencies. Second, we describearchitectural changes and performance optimizations implemented withinthe Locality-Enhanced Deployment and Configuration Engine (LE-DAnCE)implementation of the D\\&amp;C specification to obtain efficient anddeterministic deployment latencies.Results: We analyze the performance of LE-DAnCE in the context ofcomponent deployments on 10 nodes for a representative DRE systemconsisting of 1000 components and in a cluster environment with up to100 nodes. Our results show LE-DAnCE's optimizations provide a boundeddeployment latency of less than 2 s for the 1000 component scenario withjust a 4 percent jitter.Conclusion: The improvements contained in the LE-DAnCE infrastructureprovide an efficient and scaleable standards-based deployment system forcomponent-based enterprise DRE systems. In particular, deployment timeparallelism can improve deployment latency significantly, both duringpre-deployment analysis of the deployment plan and during the process ofinstalling and activating components.

The research on component-based systemshas produced component technologies for guaranteeing real-timeproperties. However, the issue of saving resources by allocating severalcomponents to real-time tasks has gained little focus. Trade-offs whenallocating components to tasks are, e.g., CPU-overhead, footprint andintegrity. In this paper we present a general approach for allocatingcomponents to real-time tasks, while utilizing existing real-timeanalysis to ensure a feasible allocation. We demonstrate thatCPU-overhead and memory consumption can be reduced by as much as 48\\%and 32\\% respectively for industrially representative systems.

CPPSs require acquisitionof production system data and smart data processing to extractinformation to improve the overall system performance. To achieve thatit is needed to bridge the gap between the control systems and higherlayers. This paper discusses an approach to use the IEC 61499 functionblock concept to exchange data between plant floor and higher layersusing an industrial standard like OPC UA. The OPC UA server offerssubscription mechanisms, making possible the integration of severalresources residing at plant floor. As it runs on embedded devices, theproposal makes possible to acquire plant information at low cost,enabling at the same time, a component-based design for enterprise plantfloor control with independence of the hardware platform used Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS); Industry 4.0; OPC-UA;Modbus/TCP | embedded devices | embedded devices | embedded devic |\n",

This paper describes agamification framework that aims to facilitate achieving greater energyconservation in public buildings. The framework leverages IoT-enabledlow-cost devices, to improve energy disaggregation mechanisms thatprovide energy use and-consequently-wastage information at the device,area and end-user level. The identified wastages are concurrentlytargeted by a gamified application that motivates respective behavioralchanges combining team competition, virtual rewards and life simulation.Our solution is being developed iteratively with the end-users'engagement during the analysis, design, development and validationphases in public buildings located in three different countries:Luxembourg (Musee National d'Histoire et d'Art), Spain(EcoUrbanBuilding, Institut Catala d'Energia headquarters, Barcelona)and Greece (General Secretariat of the Municipality of Athens). energy efficiency; gamification; energy disaggregation; employee;behavioral economics; sustainability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | energy consumption | energy consumption | energy consumpt |\n",

Data aggregation approaches havebeen widely used to enhance the performance of IoT applications. Suchapproaches reduce the number of packets that are transmitted bycombining multiple packets into one transmission unit, therebyminimising energy consumption, collisions and congestion. However,current data aggregation schemes restrict developers to a specificnetwork structure or cannot handle multi-hop data aggregation. In thispaper, we propose Hitch Hiker 2.0, a component binding model thatprovides support for multi-hop data aggregation. Hitch Hiker usescomponent meta-data to discover remote component bindings and toconstruct a multi-hop overlay network within the free payload space ofexisting traffic flows. Hitch Hiker 2.0 provides end-to-end routing oflow-priority traffic while using only a small fraction of the energy ofstandard communication. This paper extends upon our previous work byincorporating new mechanisms for decentralised route discovery andproviding additional application case studies and evaluation. We havedeveloped a prototype implementation of Hitch Hiker for the LooCIcomponent model. Our evaluation shows that Hitch Hiker consumes minimalresources and that using Hitch Hiker to deliver low-priority trafficreduces energy consumption by up to 32 \\%.

Their users range from everyday commuters to policy makers andurban planners. Given the complexity of these systems and theirenvironment, their study in real settings is frequently unfeasible.Simulations help to address this problem, but present their own issues:there can be unintended mistakes in the transition from models to code;their platforms frequently bias modeling; and it is difficult to compareworks that use different models and tools. In order to overcome theseproblems, this paper proposes a framework for a model-driven developmentof these simulations. It is based on a specific modeling language thatsupports the integrated specification of the multiple facets of an ITS:people, their vehicles, and the external environment; and a network ofsensors and actuators conveniently arranged and distributed thatoperates over them. The framework works with a model editor to generatespecifications compliant with that language, and a code generator toproduce code from them using platform specifications. There are alsoguidelines to help researchers in the application of thisinfrastructure. A case study on advanced management of traffic lightswith cameras illustrates its use. intelligent transportation system; smart city; sensor; actuator; trafficlights; simulation; model-driven engineering; modeling language;agent-based modeling; code generation | smart city   | smart city   | smart citi |\n",

In this paper, the endogenous andexogenous aspects of resilience are of cornerstone importance in systemdesign and verification. Endogenous resilience is the inherent abilityof the system to detect and process internal faults and maliciousattacks. Exogenous resilience is the permanent capability of the systemto maintain a safe operation within its ambient environment. In thispaper, we present a predictive dual-sided contract-based formalmethodology to address both aspects of resilience on top of adistributed object-oriented component-based software model. It isillustrated by a case study of urban drone rescue systems. We exploitthe formalism of timed automata and the toolbox UPPAAL to predict byabstraction and analyze (simulate and verify) endogenous resilience.Instead of presenting the final models of the case study, we reflect ourexperience with UPPAAL in generic patterns of system design and contractspecification, reusable in other contexts with adaptations. The analysisof exogenous resilience is specific to the considered drone rescuesystem. It consists of synthesizing by iterative model-checking safefiight paths for the drones within a 3D virtual model of urbansurroundings true to modern cities.

The platformfeatures are illustrated in this paper with two entertaining VRapplications based on a BCI. In the first one, users can move a virtualball by imagining hand movements, while in the second one, they cancontrol a virtual spaceship using real or imagined foot movements.Online experiments with these applications together with the evaluationof the platform computational performances showed its suitability forthe design of VR applications controlled with a BCI.

Furthermore, the DSP development tools available today areless advanced than in other embedded software design. This has lead toDSP software architectures that have not taken into account futureexpansion needs. Therefore, DSP software architectures have beeninherently closed. Now, as system complexity increases, this designmethodology becomes more of a burden, since it does not supportcomponent-based DSP software development that requires open interfaces.In this paper, mobile-communications DSP software architectures arestudied as cases, and key areas for improvements towards more open DSPsoftware development are identified.

However, interoperability andflexibility of embedded devices are key challenges for making smart hometechnology accessible to a broad audience. In particular, the softwareprograms that determine the behavior of the smart home must facilitatecustomizability and extensibility. Unlike industrial applications,typically engineered by highly skilled programmers, control andautomation programs for the smart home should be understandable bylaypeople.

Because WSN nodes are typicallybattery equipped, the primary design goal of the models is to optimizethe amount of energy used for data transmission while retaining dataaccuracy at high levels. The proposed energy conservation techniques andalgorithms are based on incremental principal component analysis andoptimal stopping theory. iPC3 and oPC3 models are presented and comparedwith PC3 and other models found in the literature through simulations.The proposed models manage to extend the lifetime of a WSN applicationby improving energy efficiency within WSN.

We then develop a configurationalgorithm using constraint satisfaction techniques over finite domainsto generate products that are consistent with respect to their ICSfamily specifications. We reason about the termination and consistencyof our configuration algorithm analytically. We evaluate theeffectiveness of our configuration approach by applying it to a realsubsea oil production system. Specifically, we have rebuilt a number ofexisting verified product configurations of our industry partner.

Inthis context, component-based design seems the more promising approach,but it suffers from the lack of a widely adopted Model of Computation(MoC) able to capture component heterogeneity. This paper proposesUNIVERCM, a new model of computation based on the HeterogeneousIntermediate Format (HIF) with the aim of supporting bottom-up designand system integration from a set of heterogeneous components. HW and SWcomponents can be described by means of different languages andaccording to different MoCs, toward a uniform intermediate descriptionbased on a rigorous semantics. A mapping from UNIVERCM to SystemC isproposed then to obtain a homogeneous description intended for fastsimulation, that can be also used as starting point for CMP designflows. Experimental results show the effectiveness of UNIVERCM inmanaging system heterogeneity.

These mismatches, if notprevented during system design, have to be tolerated during runtime.This paper presents an architectural abstraction based on exceptionhandling for structuring fault-tolerant software systems. Thisabstraction comprises several components and connectors that promote anexisting untrusted software element into an idealised fault-tolerantarchitectural element. Moreover, it is considered in the context of arigorous software development approach based on formal methods forrepresenting the structure and behaviour of the software architecture.The proposed approach relies on a formal specification and verificationfor analysing exception propagation, and verifying importantdependability properties, such as deadlock freedom, and scenarios ofarchitectural reconfiguration. The formal models are automaticallygenerated using model transformation from UML diagrams: componentdiagram representing the system structure, and sequence diagramsrepresenting the system behaviour. Finally, the formal models are alsoused for generating unit and integration test cases that are used forassessing the correctness of the source code. The feasibility of theproposed architectural approach was evaluated on an embedded criticalcase study. exception handling; fault-tolerant software architecture; model-basedtest; model checking; software verification and validation | formal specification  | formal specification  | formal specif |\n",

The implicit approach usually outperforms theexplicit one, both in terms of time and memory.This paper introduces an implicit and component-based method for thesteady-state solution of reducible Markov regenerative processes: thestrongly connected components of the characteristic matrices of theprocess are used to identify a structure of components that is exploitedby the solution process to discriminate components of the process thathave a simple or a complex structure, and corresponding lower and highersolution costs. The solution then considers one component at a time,applying to each of them the simplest solution technique adequate to theactual component complexity. An implicit approach is followed, whichsaves the cost of building and storing the EMC, but makes non trivialthe identification of the strongly connected components.The paper shows the efficacy of the method both in theory and on a setof MRPs arising from queueing networks, stochastic Petri nets and fromthe stochastic model checking of Markov chains. In particular it isshown that the cost of the model checking of the Until formula of thestochastic logic CSLTA reduces to that of CSL if the component method isused. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Asmicroprocessors become more powerful, the software complexity ofreal-time embedded systems has increased steadily. The requirements forincreased functionality and adaptability make the development ofreal-time embedded software complex and error-prone. Component-baseddesign has been widely accepted as a compositional approach tofacilitate the design of complex systems. It provides a means fordecomposing a complex system into simpler subsystems and composing thesubsystems in a hierarchical manner. A system composed of real-timesubsystems with hierarchy is called a hierarchical real-time system.This paper describes a process algebraic approach to schedulabilityanalysis of hierarchical real-time systems. To facilitate modeling andanalyzing hierarchical real-time systems, we conservatively extend anexisting process algebraic theory based on ACSR-VP (Algebra ofCommunicating Shared Resources with Value-Passing) for theschedulability of real-time systems. We explain a method to model aresource model in ACSR-VP which may be partitioned for a subsystem. Wealso introduce schedulability relation to define the schedulability ofhierarchical real-time systems and show that satisfaction checking ofthe relation is reducible to deadlock checking in ACSR-VP and can bedone automatically by the tool support of VERSA (Verification, Executionand Rewrite System for ACSR).

Unlike some works which study the connection between formalapproaches and the highest (decisional) level of the robot softwarearchitecture, where deliberative activities such as planning,diagnostics, and execution control are conducted, we tackle the problemof using formal methods for developing modules of the functional levelof robots. Little attention has been drawn to the development of thesemodules whose robustness is paramount to the robustness of the overallplatform.To this end, we have successfully developed the G(theta n)oM/BIPcomponent based design approach and applied it to the functional levelof a complex exploration rover. Here, we report on this work, and showhow we: (i) produce a very fine grained formal computational model ofthe robot functional level; (ii) run the SIP engine on the real robot,which executes and enforces the model semantics at runtime; and (iii)check the model offline for deadlock-freedom, as well as other safetyproperties.Moreover, we also extended this paradigm in a number of promisingdirections: (i) introduced a real-time BIP engine which can now use andcontrol a timed BIP model; (ii) distributed the model and the engineover multiple CPUs: (iii) proposed a user-friendly language forspecifying constraints on the model; and (iv) linked the model with atemporal plan execution controller. Interestingly, although our approachwas initially proposed for the lowest level of robot architectures,these more recent extensions now allow us to model and manage thedeliberation taking place at the decisional layer.

From standard smart homes to automated buildings, includingother kind of domotics and inmotics solutions, every system must betested and validated before its installation. The current tools offeredby IoT and home automation vendors lack in emulation features close tothe real behavior of the devices. In many cases, delaying theverification actions until the hardware is acquired and installed maycause some drawbacks, for example, from the economic point of view. Thispaper presents a solution for emulating home automation environmentswhich are based on the KNX standard and can be represented byarchitectures of devices. The emulation consist of developing virtualimplementations of real devices which operate and communicate throughweb technology. The technology implementing these virtual devices allowsus to develop components which can provide different type of datarelated to the installation (audio, video, text, animations, images,etc.).

However, they break with the traditional layered architecturethat has been so successful for over 30 years. A fully fledgedcross-layer stack requires a sophisticated software design to bemaintainable and reusable. The Trustful Space-Time Protocol (TSTP) is across-layer protocol designed to deliver authenticated, encrypted,timed, and georeferenced messages containing data compliant with theInternational System of Units (SI) in a resource-efficient way. Byintegrating shared data from multiple networking services into a singlecommunication infrastructure, TSTP is able to eliminate replication ofinformation across services, achieving small overhead regarding controlmessages. The complexity of TSTP's features, its broad range - from theapplication to the Medium Access Control, - and its experimental naturebring diverse requirements beyond those usually considered in mostsoftware designs. In this work, we show how we avoided a monolithicimplementation of the cross-layer approach with a component-baseddesign, exploring template metaprogramming techniques to adapt andcombine basic building blocks. An event-driven architecture that makesuse of zero copy buffers and metadata is used to handle crosscuttingconcerns. We validate the proposed design with an implementation forIEEE 802.15.4 networks and a set of OMNet++ simulations for relevantscenarios, showing that we achieve a light TSTP implementation that issuccessfully able to save energy and bandwidth while keeping a deliveryratio close to 100\\%.

Unanticipatedquality defects in a component can be a major source of system failure.To address this issue, this paper suggests a design verificationapproach integrated into the model-driven, component-based developmentmethodology Marmot. The notion of abstract components-the basic buildingblocks of Marmot-helps to lift the level of abstraction, facilitateshigh-level reuse, and reduces verification complexity by localizingverification problems between abstract components before refinement andafter refinement. This enables the identification of unanticipateddesign errors in the early stages of development. This work introducesthe Marmot methodology, presents a design verification approach inMarmot, and demonstrates its application on the development of amu-controller-based abstraction of a car mirror control system. Anapplication on TinyOS shows that the approach helps to reuse models aswell as their verification results in the development process.

Major improvements in acute care and diagnostics have created atendency toward the chronification of formerly terminal conditions,requiring people with these conditions to learn how to self-manage.Mobile technologies hold promise as self-management tools due to theirubiquity and cost-effectiveness. The delivery of health-related servicesthrough mobile technologies (mobile health, mHealth) has grownexponentially in recent years. However, only a fraction of thesesolutions take into consideration the views of relevant stakeholderssuch as health care professionals or even patients. The use ofbehavioral change models (BCMs) has proven important in developingsuccessful health solutions, yet engaging patients remains a challenge.There is a trend in mHealth solutions called gamification that attemptsto use game elements to drive user behavior and increase engagement. Asit stands, designers of mHealth solutions for behavioral change inchronic conditions have no clear way of deciding what factors arerelevant to consider.Objective: The goal of this work is to discover factors for the designof mHealth solutions for chronic patients using negotiations betweenmedical knowledge, BCMs, and gamification.Methods: This study uses an embedded case study research methodologyconsisting of 4 embedded units: 1) cross-sectional studies of mHealthapplications; 2) statistical analysis of gamification presence; 3) focusgroups and interviews to relevant stakeholders; and 4) research throughdesign of an mHealth solution. The data obtained was thematicallyanalyzed to create a conceptual model for the design of mHealthsolutions.Results: The Model for Motivational Mobile-health Design (3MD) forchronic conditions guides the design of condition-oriented gamifiedbehavioral change mHealth solutions. The main components are (1)condition specific, which describe factors that need to be adjusted andadapted for each particular chronic condition; (2) motivation related,which are factors that address how to influence behaviors in an engagingmanner; and (3) technology based, which are factors that are directlyconnected to the technical capabilities of mobile technologies. The 3MDalso provides a series of high-level illustrative design questions fordesigners to use and consider during the design process.Conclusions: This work addresses a recognized gap in research andpractice, and proposes a unique model that could be of use in thegeneration of new solutions to help chronic patients. chronic conditions; consumer health informatics; gamification; healthbehavioral change; medical informatics; mHealth; user-centered design;information systems | Chronic conditions | chronic conditions | chronic condit |\n",

Within this context, this papertargets the challenges that are concerned with the unambiguousrefinement of timing requirements, constraints and other timinginformation among various abstraction levels. Such information isrequired by the end-to-end timing analysis engines to providepre-run-time verification about the predictability of these systems. Thepaper proposes an approach to represent and refine such informationamong various abstraction levels. As a proof of concept, the approachprovides a representation of the timing information at the higher levelsusing the models that are developed with EAST-ADL and Timing AugmentedDescription Language. The approach then refines the timing informationfor the lower abstraction levels. The approach exploits the RubusComponent Model at the lower level to represent the timing informationthat cannot be clearly specified at the higher levels, such as triggerpaths in distributed chains. A vehicular-application case study isconducted to show the applicability of the proposed approach.

The challenge isthen to propose more flexible solutions, where components reuse isdomain agnostic. In this article, we present a framework supportingcompositional construction and development of applications that mustmeet various extra-functional/domain-specific requirements. The keypoints of our contribution are: i) We target development ofcomponent-oriented applications where extra-functional requirements areexpressed as annotations on the units of composition in the applicationarchitecture. ii) These annotations are implemented as open andextensible component-based containers, achieving full separation offunctional and extra-functional concerns. iii) Finally, the fullmachinery is implemented using the Aspect-Oriented Programming paradigm.We validate our approach with two case studies: the first is related toreal-time and embedded applications, while the second refers to thedomain of distributed context-aware middleware. component-based frameworks; domain-specific software engineering;aspect-oriented software architectures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | component-based frameworks | component-based frameworks | component-based framework |\n",

To ensure code quality and reliability,computer-aided analysis is also performed for the generated applicationsoftware in some frameworks. However, when the target is real-timeembedded systems, the correctness of the software in terms of satisfyingall user-given real-time and embedded constraints becomes a primaryobjective for such frameworks. To guarantee correctness, formalverification in the form of model checking is a viable solution due toits full automation capability. Nevertheless, little is known fromeither the existing literature or industrial experience on how formalverification can be integrated into an object-oriented applicationframework, whose primary purpose was previously only to design andgenerate application software. This work contributes to the state-of-arttechnology by showing how a design framework and a verificationframework can be integrated. Three main issues are tackled: (i) what toverify?; (ii) when to verify?; and (iii) how to verify? As a solution tothese three issues the authors propose a mapping from theobject-oriented model to a formal model, a schedule-verify-map strategyand a compositional verification methodology, respectively. These havebeen implemented in a component-based framework and experimentsperformed to illustrate their feasibility. Due to the incorporation ofindustry de-facto standards such as real-time unified modelling languageand real-time Java, in the proposed techniques it should now be possiblefor an engineer to gain access to theoretically proven formalverification technologies that would otherwise be considered to beinaccessible to an engineer unskilled in verification techniques.

Passive replication minimizes resourceconsumption by only activating redundant replicas in case of failures,as typically, providing and applying state updates is less resourcedemanding than requesting execution. However, most existing solutionsfor passive fault tolerance are usually designed and configured atdesign time, explicitly and statically identifying the most criticalcomponents and their number of replicas, lacking the needed flexibilityto handle the runtime dynamics of distributed component-based embeddedsystems. This paper proposes a cost-effective adaptive fault tolerancesolution with a significant lower overhead compared to a strict activeredundancy-based approach, achieving a high error coverage with aminimum amount of redundancy. The activation of passive replicas iscoordinated through a feedback-based coordination model that reduces thecomplexity of the needed interactions among components until a newcollective global service solution is determined, hence improving theoverall maintainability and robustness of the system.

Third, we empiricallyevaluate the client failover and group shutdown capabilities of CORFUand its CHESS module and compare/contrast it with existingobject-oriented fault-tolerance methods.

However,existing approaches have critical weakness. First, existing approachestypically require a component's source code to be available if you wishto strip (or re-insert) checks. Second, documentation of the contract iseither distributed separately from the component or embedded in thecomponent's source code. Third, enabling and disabling specific kinds ofchecks on separate components from independent vendors can be asignificant challenge. This paper describes an approach to representingcontracts for .NET components using attributes. This contractinformation can be retrived from the compiled component's metadata andused for many purposes. The paper also describes nContract, a tool thatautomatically generates run-time checks from embedded contracts. Suchrun-time checks can be generated and added to a system withoutrequiringt source code access or recompilation. Further, when checks fora given component are excluded, they impose no run-time overhead.Finally, a highly expressive, fine-grained mechanism for controllinguser preferences about which specific checks are enabled or disabled ispresented. design by contract; assertion checkers; dynamic verification;component-based software; binary components; preconditions;postconditions; invariants; coding techniques; debugging aids;specification | design contract | design contract | design contract |\n",

This paperpresents a new predictable component model for real-time systems(UM-RTCOM) together with a set of tools to support it. The environmentallows new components to be developed which can then be assembled tobuild complete applications, including hardware interaction. The modelincludes support for real-time analysis at the component and applicationlevel. The analysis is achieved by combining component meta-informationin the form of an abstract behaviour model and a method to measureworst-case execution times in the final platform. Additionally, wepropose an implementation model based on RT-CORBA where the developeruses the UM-RTCOM components and a set of tools to map these elements toelements of the desired platform.

This paper investigates the use ofonline MPC, in which at each step, an optimization problem is solved, onboth a programmable automation controller (PAC) and a programmable logiccontroller (PLC). Three different optimization routines to solve thequadratic program were investigated with respect to their applicabilityon these devices. To this end, an air heating setup was built andselected as a small-scalemulti-input single-output system. It turns outthat the code generator (CVXGEN) is not suited for the PLC as therequired programming language is not available and the programmingconcept with preallocated memory consumes too much memory. The Hildrethand qpOASES algorithms successfully controlled the setup running on thePLC hardware. Both algorithms perform similarly, although it takes moretime to calculate a solution for qpOASES. However, if the problem sizeincreases, it is expected that the high number of required iterationswhen the constraints are hit will cause the Hildreth algorithm to exceedthe necessary time to present a solution. For this small heating problemunder test, the Hildreth algorithm is selected as most useful on a PLC. NA | embedded controllers | embedded controllers | embedded control |\n",

While theharvested power is often less than 1 mW, the commercial-off-the-shelfpower management circuits designed for conventional battery applicationsoperate in much higher power. A designated power management module forsub-mW energy harvester is proposed in this article to increase theenergy conversion efficiency and extend the energy storage lifetime forsmall input power. The proposed module consists of discretecomponent-based pulse-width modulation (PWM) controlled synchronousboost converter structured impedance matching circuit andsupercapacitor/micro-battery hybrid energy storage. The synchronousboost converter-based power management circuit achieves 79\\% conversionefficiency at the input power of 0.5 mW. The power loss during theenergy conversion is significantly reduced and thus allows wirelesssensor nodes to be powered from a minimum of 120 Lux fluorescent lightwith a photovoltaic cell smaller than a credit card. Thesupercapacitor/micro-battery energy storage provides lifetime of morethan 73 h when no external energy is available. The experimental resultswith 25 energy harvester-powered wireless sensor nodes demonstrate thatthe practical ultra-low-power design makes sub-1-mW energy harvesterpower management applicable.

According tothis Standard, a Function Block (FB) is all event-triggered componentand an application is an FB network that has to meet temporal propertiesaccording to user requirements. If a reconfiguration scenario is appliedat run-time, then the FB network implementing the application is totallychanged or modified. To cover all possible cases, we classify suchscenarios into three classes and we define an agent-based architecturedesigned with nested state machines to automatically handle all possiblereconfigurations. To verify and assign Function Blocks corresponding toeach reconfiguration scenario into the execution environment, we definean approach based on the exploration of reachability graphs to verifytemporal properties. This approach constructs feasible Operating Systemtasks encoding the FB network that corresponds to each scenario.Therefore, the application is considered as sets of Operating System(OS) tasks where each set is to load in memory when the correspondingreconfiguration scenario is applied by the agent. We developed the toolX-Assign supporting these contributions that we apply on the FESTOproduction system available in our research laboratory.

These goals are at odds, and compilers can only rarelytranslate expressive high-level programs to modern hardware platforms ina way that makes best use of the available resources.Generative programming is a promising alternative to fully automatictranslation. Instead of writing down the target program directly,developers write a program generator, which produces the target programas its output. The generator can be written in a high-level, genericstyle and can still produce efficient, specialized target programs. Inpractice, however, developing high-quality program generators requires avery large effort that is often hard to amortize.We present lightweight modular staging (LMS), a generative programmingapproach that lowers this effort significantly. LMS seamlessly combinesprogram generator logic with the generated code in a single program,using only types to distinguish the two stages of execution. Throughextensive use of component technology, LMS makes a reusable andextensible compiler framework available at the library level, allowingprogrammers to tightly integrate domain-specific abstractions andoptimizations into the generation process, with common genericoptimizations provided by the framework.LMS is well suited to develop embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs)and has been used to develop powerful performance-oriented DSLs fordemanding domains such as machine learning, with code generation forheterogeneous platforms including GPUs. LMS has also been used togenerate SQL for embedded database queries and JavaScript for webapplications. NA | high performance | high performance | high perform |\n",

SCA applications are portable acrossdifferent heterogeneous embedded distributed system. For performancereasons, application software gets optimized using specializedinstructions sets supported by General Purpose Processors, DigitalSignal Processors Graphical Processing Units.

Without complementary verification andcertification methods the benefits of these development techniques arereduced. As part of certification, it is necessary to show a system isacceptably safe which subsumes both the normal and abnormal (failure)cases. However, nonfunctional properties, such as safety and failures,are abstraction breakers, cutting across multiple components. Also, muchof the work on component-based engineering has been applied tosoftware-based systems rather than field programmable gate array(FPGA)-based systems whose use is becoming more popular in industry. Inthis paper, we show how a modular design embedded on a FPGA can beexhaustively analyzed (from a safety perspective) to derive the failureand safety properties to give the evidence needed for a safety case. Thespecific challenges faced are analyzing the fault characteristics ofindividual electronic components, combining the results across softwaremodules, and then feeding this into a system safety case. A secondarybenefit of taking this approach is that there is less uncertainty in theperformance of the device, hence, it can be used for higher integritysystems. Finally, design improvements can be specifically targeted atareas of safety concern, leading to more optimal utilization of the FPGAdevice.

In most actor-oriented models, actors areself-contained and data channels are the only sharable object betweenactors, and they compose a system in a flat layer. In contrast, it iscommon to use shared library functions and construct vertically layeredsoftware for efficiency and modularity. To fill this gap betweenmodeling and implementation, we propose a special actor, library task,with new types of ports: library master port and library slave port. Itis a sharable and mappable object that defines a set of functioninterfaces inside. N:1 master-slave connection allows sharing a librarytask and the master-slave connection can specify vertically layeredsoftware and client-server applications naturally.To support the library task in our embedded software design environment,we develop an automatic mapping algorithm as well as an automatic codegenerator. The design environment with the library task is applied fortwo target platforms: IBM CELL Broadband Engine and an ARM-basedmulticore simulator.

For embedded scenarios with strictenergy constraints such as automotive image processing, FPGAs representa feasible power-efficient computer platform. Unfortunately, theirhardware-driven design concept results in long development cycles andimpedes their acceptance in industrial practice. Additionally, theverification of the FPGA's correctness and its performance figures areunavailable until a very late development stage, which is criticalduring design space exploration and the integration in complex embeddedsystems. Weakly-programmable architectures, supporting design andrun-time reuse via flexible hardware components, represent a promisingand efficient FPGA development approach. However, they currently lacksuitable design and verification methodologies for real-time scenarios.Therefore, this paper proposes a system-level FPGA development conceptfor video applications with weakly-programmable hardware components. Itcombines rapid software prototyping with component-based FPGA design andadvanced formal real-time analysis and code generation techniques. Thepresented approach enables an early verification of the application'scorrectness, including exact performance figures. It provides asoftware-level verification of weakly-programmable hardware componentsand an automated assembly of the final hardware design. The developedtools and their usability are demonstrated by a binarization and a denseblock matching application, which represents a basic preprocessing stepin automotive image processing for driver assistance systems.

When considering resilient embedded systems that must complywith stringent dependability requirements, the challenge is evengreater, as evolution must not impair dependability attributes.Maintaining dependability properties when facing changes is, indeed, theexact definition of resilient computing. In this paper, we consider theevolution of systems with respect to their dependability mechanisms andshow how such mechanisms can evolve with the system evolution, in thecase of ROS, the robot operating system. We provide a synthesis of theconcepts required for resilient computing using a component-basedapproach. We particularly emphasize the process and the techniquesneeded to implement an adaptation layer for fault tolerance mechanisms.In the light of this analysis, we address the implementation of adaptivefault tolerance on ROS in 2 steps: Firstly, we provide an architectureto implement fault tolerance mechanisms in ROS, and secondly, wedescribe the actual adaptation of fault tolerance mechanisms in ROS.Beyond the implementation details given in the paper, we draw thelessons learned from this work and discuss the limits of this run-timesupport to implement adaptive fault tolerance features in embeddedsystems. adaptive fault tolerance; resilience; ROS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | system evolution | system evolution | system evolut |\n",

This presents problemsif the context is families of industrial products with frequent releaseof upgraded or new members. Managing complexity using a low-levelspecification is extremely challenging and impacts developerproductivity.

A new approach termed Concept-Based Partitioning ispresented that focuses on system evolution, product lines, andlarge-scale reuse when partitioning.

They increase confidence andpotentially provide rich feedback. However, with increasing complexity,verification tools themselves are more likely to contain errors.In contrast to automatic verification tools, higher-order theoremprovers use mathematically founded proof strategies checked by a smallproof checker to guarantee selected properties. Thus, they enjoy a highlevel of trustability. Properties of software and hardware systems andtheir justifications can be encapsulated into a certificate, therebyguaranteeing correctness of the systems, with respect to the properties.These results offer a much higher degree of confidence than resultsachieved by verification tools. However, higher-order theorem proversare usually slow, due to their general and minimalistic nature. Even forsmall systems, a lot of human interaction is required for establishing acertificate.In this work, we combine the advantages of automatic verification tools(i.e., speed and automation) with those of higher-order theorem provers(i.e., high level of trustability). The verification tool generates acertificate for each invocation. This is checked by the higher-ordertheorem prover, thereby guaranteeing the desired property. Thegeneration of certificates is much easier than producing the analysisresults of the verification tool in the first place. In our work, we areable to create certificates that come with an algorithmic description ofthe proof of the desired property as justification. We concentrate onverification tools that generate invariants of systems and certifyautomatically that these do indeed hold. Our approach is applied to thecertification of the verdicts of a deadlock-detection tool for anasynchronous component-based language.

Reducingthe energy overheads of sensor data acquisition and processing isessential to ensure the successful continuous operation of suchapplications, especially on battery-limited mobile devices. To achievethis goal, this paper presents a framework, called ACQUA, for`acquisition-cost' aware continuous query processing. ACQUA replaces thecurrent paradigm, where the data is typically streamed (pushed) from thesensors to the one or more smartphones, with a pull-based asynchronousmodel, where a smartphone retrieves appropriate blocks of relevantsensor data from individual sensors, as an integral part of the queryevaluation process. We describe algorithms that dynamically optimize thesequence (for complex stream queries with conjunctive and disjunctivepredicates) in which such sensor data streams are retrieved by the queryevaluation component, based on a combination of (a) the communicationcost \\&amp; selectivity properties of individual sensor streams, and (b) theoccurrence of the stream predicates in multiple concurrently executingqueries. We also show how a transformation of a group of stream queriesinto a disjunctive normal form provides us with significantly greaterdegrees of freedom in choosing this sequence, in which individual sensorstreams are retrieved and evaluated. While the algorithms can apply to abroad category of sensor-based applications, we specifically demonstratetheir application to a scenario where multiple stream processing queriesexecute on a single smartphone, with the sensors transferring their dataover an appropriate PAN technology, such as Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11.Extensive simulation experiments indicate that ACQUA's intelligentbatch-oriented data acquisition process can result in as much as 80 \\%reduction in the energy overhead of continuous query processing, withoutany loss in the fidelity of the processing logic.

Typically, suchsystems consist of embedded computers that monitor and control physicalprocesses in a feedback loop. While modern electronic systems areincreasingly characterized as CPS, their design and synthesis still relyon traditional methods, which lack systematic and automated techniquesfor accomplishment.Recently, IEC 61499 has been proposed as a standard for designingindustrial process-control and measurement systems. It prescribes acomponent-based approach for developing industrial automation softwareusing function blocks. Executable code can then be automaticallygenerated and simulated from these function blocks. This bodes well fordesigners of CPS, who are more likely to be experts in specificindustrial domains, rather than in computer science. The intuitivegraphical nature and automatic code synthesis of IEC 61499 programs willalleviate the programming burden of industrial engineers, while ensuringmore reliable software. While software synthesis from IEC 61499 programsis not new the generation of efficient code from them has been wanting.This has made it difficult for function blocks to be used in softwaredevelopment for resource-constrained embedded controllers commonlyemployed in CPS. To address this, we present an approach that cangenerate very efficient code from function block descriptions.Experimental results from a benchmark suite shows that our approachproduces substantially faster and smaller code compared to existingtechniques.

In this paper, weintroduce a novel model-based approach for constructing correctdistributed implementation of component-based models constrained bypriorities. We argue that model-based methods are especially of interestin the context of distributed embedded systems due to their inherentcomplexity (e.g., caused by non-deterministic nature of distributedsystems). Our method is designed based on three phases oftransformation. The input is a model specified in terms of a set ofbehavioral components that interact through a set of high-levelsynchronization primitives (e.g., rendezvous and broadcasts) andpriority rules for scheduling purposes. The first phase transforms theinput model into a model that has no priorities. Then, the second phasetransforms the deprioritized model into another model that resolvesdistributed conflicts by incorporating a solution to the committeecoordination problem. Finally, the third phase generates distributedcode using asynchronous point-to-point message passing primitives (e.g.,TCP sockets). All transformations preserve the properties of their inputmodel by ensuring observational equivalence. All the transformations areimplemented and our experiments validate their effectiveness.

However, as the number ofcomponent-based applications in modern automotive embedded systems growsrapidly and the hardware topology becomes increasingly complex,deploying such large number of components in automotive distributedsystem in manual way is over-dependent on experience of engineers whichin turn is time consuming. Furthermore, the resource limitation andscheduling analysis make the problems more complex for developers tofind out an approximate optimal deploying approach in systemintegration. In this paper, we propose a novel method to deploy theAUTOSAR components onto ECUs with the following features. First, aclustering algorithm is designed for deploying components automaticallywithin relatively low time complexity. Second, a fitness function isdesigned to balance the ECUs load.

The synchronous dataflow (SDF) model isparticularly well-suited to dataflow-based graphical programming becauseits restricted semantics offer strong formal properties and significantcompile-time predictability, while capturing the behavior of a largeclass of important signal processing applications. When synthesizingsoftware for embedded signal processing applications, criticalconstraints arise due to the limited amounts of memory. In this paper,we propose a solution to the problem of jointly optimizing the code anddata size when converting SDF programs into software implementations.We consider two approaches. The first is a customization to acyclicgraphs of a bottom-up technique, called pairwise grouping of adjacentnodes (PGAN), that was proposed earlier for general SDF graphs. We showthat our customization to acyclic graphs significantly reduces thecomplexity of the general PGAN algorithm, and we present a formal studyof our modified PGAN technique that rigorously establishes itsoptimality for a certain class of applications. The second approach thatwe consider is a top-down technique, based on a generalized minimum-cutoperation, that was introduced recently in {[}14]. We present theresults of an extensive experimental investigation on the performance ofour modified PGAN technique and the top-down approach and on thetradeoffs between them. Based on these results, we conclude that thesetwo techniques complement each other, and thus, they should both beincorporated into SDF-based software implementation environments inwhich the minimization of memory requirements is important. We haveimplemented these algorithms in the Ptolemy software environment {[}5]at UC Berkeley. dataflow programming; synchronous dataflow; memory management; multiratesignal processing algorithms; SDF compiler; on-chip memory; clustering;minimum cuts; dynamic programming | -chip memory | -chip memory | -chip memori |\n",

Areal-time contract determines the fulfillment of a component's responsetime requirements when it operates in a client-server relation withother components. This represents a typical contract testing scenario inwhich the client component needs to assess the timely response of anassociated server component according to its usage profile of thatserver. The basic model of built-in contract testing technology iscapable of assessing the correctness of behavioral contracts betweencomponents in this way. This chapter introduces an extension to thebasic built-in contract testing model that puts components into theposition to assess their deployment environment with respect to responsetime specifications. This extended model of built-in contract testingrequires some additional built-in test architecture for components plusan automatic test case generator that is based on search heuristics.

Poor clinical outcomes are primarily causedby delayed recognition, especially due to diverse clinical diagnosticcriteria with complex manifestations, irregular episodes, and alreadyoverloaded clinical activities. With the proliferation of measuringdevices and increased computational capabilities, cyber-physicalcharacterization plays an increasingly important role in many domains toprovide enabling technologies. This paper presents a cyber-physicalsystem (CPS) framework to assist physicians in making earlier diagnosesof paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity based on existing medicalknowledge. We propose a configurable diagnostic knowledge model tocharacterize clinical criteria to reduce domain knowledge deficiencybetween physicians and computer scientists. We present a component-basedmedical CPS framework to employ the knowledge models and integratemedical devices. Our approach aims to relieve medical staff from theheavy burden of clinical activities and to provide timely decisionsupport. We evaluate our approach on 128 realworld clinical cases.Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, the results demonstratethat we enable early detection in 11.02\\% more patients and detect thecondition 16.57 hours earlier on average.

However, reliance on suchschemes may expose the network to large impacts - including blackouts -if the SPS does not respond as designed, so the deployment of SPS shouldbalance risks and benefits. This paper formulates a risk-basedcost-benefit framework that allows the operator to strike an optimalbalance between constraint costs and risks of demand curtailment due tomalfunctioning SPS. It is applied to a simple 4-bus power systeminspired by the GB network, for which an exact optimisation problem canbe formulated. A component-based dependability model is developed forthe SPS to determine its failure modes and associated probabilities. Theresulting cost-minimisation problem is solved for a range of operatingconditions and SPS reliability levels. The results consistently showcost savings from the use of an SPS, even if it is highly unreliable,when a hedging strategy may be used. The optimal solution is highlysensitive to the problem parameters, but it is demonstrated that optimaloperational strategies are associated with particular SPS outcomes. Thisfinding may be used as empirical guidance to develop operationalstrategies for complex networks with unreliable SPS. (C) 2016 TheAuthors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Because churned objects areshort-lived, they appear to be good candidates for stack allocation.Unfortunately, most churned objects escape their allocating function,making escape analysis ineffective.We reduce object churn with three contributions. First, we formalize twomeasures of churn, capture and control (15). Second, we developlightweight dynamic analyses for measuring both capture and control.Third, we develop an algorithm that uses capture and control to inlineportions of the call graph to make churned objects non-escaping,enabling churn optimization via escape analysis.JOLT is a lightweight dynamic churn optimizer that uses our algorithms.We embedded JOLT in the JIT compiler of the IBM J9 commercial JVM, andevaluated JOLT on large application frameworks, including Eclipse andJBoss. We found that JOLT eliminates over 4 times as many allocations asa state-of-the-art escape analysis alone.

A runnable virtual node is acoarse-grained software component that provides functional and temporalisolation with respect to its environment. Its interaction with theenvironment is bounded both by a functional and a temporal interface,and the validity of its internal temporal behaviour is preserved whenintegrated with other components or when reused in a new environment.Our realization of RVN exploits the latest techniques for hierarchicalscheduling to achieve temporal isolation, and the principles fromcomponent-based software-engineering to achieve functional isolation. Ituses a two-level deployment process, i.e. deploying functional entitiesto RVNs and then deploying RVNs to physical nodes, and thus also givesdevelopment benefits with respect to composability, system integration,testing, and validation. In addition, we have implemented a server-basedinter-RVN communication strategy to not only support the predictableintegration and reuse properties of RVNs by keeping the communicationcode in a separate server, but also increasing the maintainability andflexibility to change the communication code without affecting thetiming properties of RVNs. We have applied our approach to a case study,implemented in the ProCom component technology executing on top of aFreeRTOS-based hierarchical scheduling framework and present the resultsas a proof-of-concept.

Factors affectingthe software complexity of components embedded in an ECU depend not onlyon their interface and interaction properties, but also on thestructural constraints characterized by a component's functionalsemantics and timing constraints described by AUTomotive Open SystemARchitecture (AUTOSAR) languages. Traditional constraint complexitymeasures are not adequate for the components in embedded softwaresystems as they do not yet sufficiently provide a measure of thecomplexity due to timing constraints which are important for quantifyingthe dynamic behavior of components at run-time. This paper presents amethod for measuring the constraint complexity of components inautomotive embedded software systems at the specification level. Itfirst enables system designers to define non-deterministic constraintson the event chains associated with components using the AUTOSAR-basedModeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems (MARTE)-UML andTiming Augmented Description Language (TADL). Then, system analysts useUnified Modeling Language (UML)-compliant Object Constraint Language(OCL) and its Real-time extension (RT-OCL) to specify the structural andtiming constraints on events and event chains and estimate theconstraint complexity of components using a measure we have developed. Apreliminary version of the method was presented in M. Garg and R. Lai,Measuring the constraint complexity of automotive embedded softwaresystems, in Proc. Int. Conf. Data and Software Engineering, 2014, pp.1-6. To demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we have applied it toan automotive Anti-lock Brake System (ABS).

This is a challenging,time-consuming, and error-prone process requiring significantinteraction between engineers and software programmers. Furthermore, theresulting code generally lacks. modularity and robustness in thepresence of failure. Model-based programming addresses theselimitations, allowing engineers to program reactive systems byspecifying high-level control strategies and by assembling commonsensemodels of the system hardware and software. In executing a controlstrategy, model-based executives reason about the models ``on the fly,`` to track system state, diagnose faults, and perform reconfigurations.This paper develops the Reactive Model-Based Programming Language (RMPL)and its executive, called Titan. RMPL provides the features ofsynchronous, reactive languages, with the added ability of reading andwriting to state variables that are hidden within the physical plantbeing controlled. Titan executes an RMPL program using extensivecomponent-based declarative models of the plant to track states, analyzeanomalous situations, and generate novel control sequences. Within itsreactive control loop, Titan employs propositional inference to deducethe system's current and desired states, and it employs model-basedreactive planning to move the plant from the current to the desiredstate. constraint programming; model-based autonomy; model-based execution;model-based programming; model-based reasoning; robotic execution;synchronous programming | ; robotic execution;synchronous programming | ; robotic execution;synchronous programming | ; robotic execution;synchronous program |\n",

SS and UWB technologies have many advantages over NB, which makethem preferable for WSN. Synchronisation of different nodes in a WSN isan important task that is necessary to improve cooperation and lifetimeof nodes. Code acquisition is the main step of a node's timesynchronisation. In this article, a pseudo noise code generator and acode acquisition circuit are proposed, designed and tested using directsequence SS technique. To investigate the properties of the designedcircuits, simulations are carried out via Xilinx Foundation Seriessoftware in the real mode. The results demonstrate excellent performanceof the proposed algorithms and circuits in all realistic conditions. Thecode acquisition circuit proposed an adaptive testing window for singledwell serial search method. The code acquisition circuit is a clockphase free approach, thus the clock coherency step is cancelled.Moreover, clock phase difference between transmitter and receiver nodesdoes not mostly affect the acquisition and thus synchronisation time. code acquisition circuit; direct sequence; pseudo noise; spreadspectrum; synchronisation; adaptive testing window; wireless sensornetwork | ; wireless sensornetwork | ; wireless sensornetwork | ; wireless sensornetwork |\n",

In this and other areas ofmanufacturing and materials handling, these legacy automationtechnologies are increasingly limiting for the growing demand forsystems that are reconfigurable, fault tolerant, and easy to maintain.IEC 61499 Function Blocks is an emerging architectural framework for thedesign of distributed industrial automation systems and their reusablecomponents. A number of architectures have been suggested for multiagentand holonic control systems that incorporate function blocks. This paperpresents a multiagent control approach for a baggage handling system(BHS) using IEC 61499 Function Blocks. In particular, it focuses ondemonstrating a decentralized control system that is scalable,reconfigurable, and fault tolerant. The design follows the automationobject approach, and produces a function block component representing asingle section of conveyor. In accordance with holonic principles, thiscomponent is autonomous and collaborative, such that the structure andthe behavior of a BHS can be entirely defined by the interconnection ofthese components within the function block design environment.Simulation is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the agent-basedcontrol system and a utility is presented for real-time viewing of thesesystems. Tests on a physical conveyor test system demonstrateddeployment to embedded control hardware.Note to Practitioners-It is well recognized that flexibility andreconfigurability of manufacturing systems pose a major challenge totheir automation. There is also a belief among automation researchersthat decentralized intelligent control will contribute significantly tothe flexibility of manufacturing systems. Achievements in practicalapplications using decentralized control have been limited by thestanding tradition of automation design with centralized logic executedon programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The new programmingarchitecture defined by IEC 61499 is specifically designed fordistributed applications and invalidates many existing assumptions aboutthe difficulty of implementing these systems using partially or fullydecentralized execution.In this paper, we present results of developing a distributed automationarchitecture based on IEC 61499 for airport baggage handling systems.Such systems are constantly undergoing reconfiguration, repair andexpansion so flexibility is a vital design metric. We demonstrateseveral sides of ``flexibility{''} enabled by IEC 61499, includingcomponent reuse, maintenance and human interaction, and reconfiguration.

In such resource-poor platforms, the ability to efficientlydelimit and reconfigure the necessary portion of sensor software-insteadof updating the full binary image-is of vital importance. However, mostexisting approaches in this field have not been adopted widely to datedue to the extensive use of WSN resources or lack of generality. In thisarticle, we therefore consider WSN programming models and runtimereconfiguration models as two interrelated factors and we present anintegrated approach for addressing efficient reprogramming in WSNs. Themiddleware solution we propose, REMOWARE, is characterized by mitigatingthe cost of post-deployment software updates on sensor nodes via thenotion of in situ reconfigurability and providing a component-basedprogramming abstraction in order to facilitate the development ofdynamic WSN applications. Our evaluation results show that REMOWAREimposes a very low energy overhead in code distribution and componentreconfiguration and consumes approximately 6\\% of the total code memoryon a TELOSB sensor platform.

However, composing a system from many reconfigurablecomponents can lead to a huge number of possible system configurations,inducing a complexity that cannot be handled during system design. Toovercome this problem, we propose a new component-based modeling andverification method for adaptive embedded systems. The component-basedmodeling approach facilitates abstracting a composition of components toa hierarchical component. In the hierarchical component, the number ofpossible configurations of the composition is reduced to a small numberof hierarchical configurations. Only these hierarchical configurationshave to be considered when the hierarchical component is used in furthercompositions such that design complexity is reduced at each hierarchicallevel. In order to ensure well-definedness of components, we provide amodel of computation enabling the formal verification of criticalrequirements of the adaptation behavior.

With this increasing complexity of the system design, ithas become very critical to enhance system design productivity to meetthe time-to-market demands and reduce product development cost.Real-time embedded system designers are facing extreme challenges in theunderlying architectural design selection. This involves the selectionof a programmable, concurrent, heterogeneous multiprocessor architectureplatform. Such a multiprocessor-system-on-chip platform has setinnovative trends for the real-time systems and system-on-chipdesigners. The consequences of this trend imply a shift in concern fromcomputation and sequential algorithms to modeling concurrency,synchronization, and communication in every aspect of hardware andsoftware co-design and development. Therefore, there is a need for ahigh level methodology that can provide a complete system modeling andarchitecture/component selection platform. The proposed six-step systemmodeling methodology provides a process for performance driven componentselection, to avoid costly iterative system design re-spins, therebyenhancing system design productivity. We demonstrate our methodology byapplying it onto a network-on-chip architecture for selecting itscomponents given certain system specification and system-levelperformance requirements.

Currently, many approaches are proposed to aid the developmentand evaluation of secure components. However, it is well known amongpractitioners that, like any other software entities, components cannotbe completely secure. This fact leads us to incorporate intrusiondetection facilities to equip components with mechanisms to discoverintrusions against components. In this paper, we present a framework fordeveloping components with intrusion detection capabilities. Thisframework uses UMLintr, a UML profile for intrusion specifications. Theprofile allows developers to specify intrusion scenarios using UMLdiagrams. Specifying intrusion scenarios using the same language that isused for specifying software behavior eliminates the need for separatelanguages for describing intrusions. Other software specificationlanguages can be easily adopted into this framework. The outcome of thisframework are components equipped with intrusion detectors. Based onUMLintr, a prototype is built and used to generate signatures for someintrusions included in the benchmark DARPA attack datasets. Furthermore,we describe an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which uses thesesignatures to detect component intrusions.

However, they do not handle the high levelcomplexity related to discretization methods and physical models.Generative programming and Domain Specific Languages (DSL) are keytechnologies allowing to write code with a high level expressivelanguage and take advantage of the efficiency of generated code with lowlevel services. DSL may be embedded in host languages like Python orC++. Such languages, named in that case Domain Specific EmbeddedLanguages (DSEL), are applied for instance in frameworks like Fenics orFeel++ which are dedicated to the domain of Finite Element (FE) methodsand Galerkin methods. ArcFVDSL is a DSEL developed on top of the Arcaneframework, aiming to implement various lowest order methods(Finite-Volume (FV), Mimetic Finite Difference (MFD), Mixed HybridFinite Volume (MHFV), etc.) for diffusive problems on general meshes. Inthis paper, we present various implementations of different complexacademic problems. We focus on the capability of the language to allowthe description and the resolution of these problems with severallowest-order methods. We illustrate the benefits of such technologycombined to runtime system tools like Heterogeneous Abstract RunTimeSystem (HARTS) and its ability to handle seamlessly new heterogeneousarchitectures with multi-core processors enhanced by General Purposecomputing on Graphics Processing Units (GP-GPU).

Inparticular, in a time critical environment, temporal correlation ofstreaming sensor data should be monitored. A run-time monitor isembedded in the server for such applications, in order to detecterroneous conditions, and perform appropriate reactions in a timelymanner. However, modification of the monitor may require stop andrestart of the server, in order to take effect. This kind of option isnot permissible where the server should be performing continuously. Inthis paper, we propose a component based reconfigurable sensor networkmonitor designed for handling time critical requirements. In order toallow dynamic modification, we implement both the server and the monitoron the Fractal Component model, which enables us to reconfigure thesystem architecture in run-time. For detecting violation of the timingcondition, we specify timing constraints, and design the monitor onFractal Aspect Component. The architecture can be formally verified byFractal-ADL and Alloy. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposedframework, by developing a smart cruise control system.

The viewpoint of the use case modelthat views a system as a black box focuses on descriptions of externalinteractions between the system and related environments. However, forembedded systems that do not disclose most implementation logics outsidethe system, black box-based use case models may experience the drawbackthat considerable information that must be defined for systemdevelopments is omitted. To solve this shortcoming, several studies havebeen proposed on the use of kind of white box technique in which thedynamic behaviors of embedded systems are defined first using a statediagram and the results are reflected in the requirement specifications.However, white box-based modeling has not been widely adopted bydevelopers due to tasks that require a lot of time in the requirementanalysis phase in the initial phase of the software development lifecycle. This study proposes a gray box-based requirement specificationmethod as a trade-off between two contradictory elements (the amount ofinformation required to develop an embedded system and the cost of theeffort required during the requirement analysis phase) in terms of thetwo approaches, the black and the white box-based models. The proposedmethod suggests that an appropriate depth level of embedded systemmodeling is required to define the requirements. This study alsoproposes a mechanism that automatically generates an applicationprogramming interface for each component based on the created model. Theproposed method was applied to the development of a camera sensorcontroller in a mobile phone, and the case results proved thefeasibility of the method through discussion of the application results. embedded system; automatic requirement specifications; state model;camera sensor'</li><li>'Analysis of an Intelligent Graphical Tutoring System Using the Internetof Things (IoT) to Develop the Competency of Embedded Systems The objectives of this research are to analyse and assess an intelligentgraphical tutoring system using the internet of things (IoT) to developthe efficiency of embedded systems.

In this way it ispossible to investigate the effects of power converter faults inelectrical drives with the aim to propose solutions that allow to reducethe periods of drives inoperability. In this paper, a suitablerealization of a test bench combining an embedded system based on a FPGAboard with a high-level graphical programming language is proposed toreplace part of the electrical drive hardware. Differently than standardapproaches for FPGA programming, which are normally based on hardwaredescription languages, the proposed solution exploits an environmentsoftware platform with a high level of abstraction that leads to a goodtrade-off between accuracy and hardware resources, also allowing afaster prototyping procedure. The proposed HIL solution has been used tostudy some common faults occurring in power converters, evaluating thebehavior of a standard drive operating with different controlalgorithms.

The typical specialization process is based on a mixof precompiler macros and build scripts, both of which are known forbeing sources of errors.In this article, we present a new model-based approach to the design ofapplication-specific RTOS. Starting with finite state models describingthe RTOS and the application requirements, the set of blocks in the RTOScode actually used by the application is automatically computed. Thisset is used to build an application-specific RTOS model. This model isfed into a code generator to produce the source code of anapplication-specific RTOS. It is also used to carry on model-basedvalidations and verifications, including the formal verification thatthe specialization process did not introduce unwanted behaviors orsuppress expected ones.To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, it is applied tospecialize Trampoline, an open-source implementation of the AUTOSAR OSstandard, to an industrial case study from the automotive domain.

However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication. We present an algorithm that transforms component-baseddesign spaces, expressible in CoDeL, to an SMT program, which, solved bystate-of-the-art SMT solvers, determines the satisfiability of thesynthesis problem, and delivers a correct-by-construction systemconfiguration. Evaluation results for use cases in the domain ofscheduling and mapping of distributed real-time processes confirm,first, the performance gain of SMT compared to traditional design spaceexploration approaches, second, the usability gains by expressing designproblems in CoDeL, and third, the capability of the CoDeL/SMT approachto support the design of embedded systems.

As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess. To demonstrate these capabilities, the methodology is testedwith two large examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While technologyexists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-basedapplications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools.Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very fewexisting and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution todevelopers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integratedmodel-driven development environment that addresses all phases ofapplication lifecycle including design, development, verification,analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, withsupporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such amodel-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, thispaper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMSML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specificsub-languages. We claim that the language promotes``correct-by-construction{\\'\\'} software development and integration bysupporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle. Using acase study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS ML impacts thedevelopment of embedded systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in {[}1]). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself. We first present a performance analysis ofdifferent JIT compilation technologies in order to identify hardware andsoftware optimization opportunities. Second, we propose a solution basedon a dedicated processor with specialized instructions for criticalfunctions of JIT compilers. These specialized instructions provide anaverage 5x speedup on manipulations of associative arrays and dynamicmemory allocation. Based on the LLVM framework, we show a 15\\\\% overallspeedup on code generator\\'s execution time. Because our specializedinstructions are hidden behind standard libraries, we also argue thatthese instructions may be transparently reused for a wider range ofapplications.

These components need to interact in atimely fashion to achieve the system level end-to-end requirements. Inpractice, the component level timing specification consists of designattributes like component task mapping, task period and scheduledefinition but often lack details on their real-time (functional)requirements. As we observe, there is no systematic methodology in placefor decomposing the feature level timing requirements into componentlevel timing requirements. This paper proposes an early stagetime-budgeting methodology to bridge the above gap. A salient proposalof this methodology is to consider parameterized componenttiming-requirements. A key step in the methodology involves computing aset of constraints by relating component requirements with featurerequirements. This enables the separation of timing constraints fromfunctionality decomposition, and facilitates early optimization of thecomponent time-budget for a complex component based embedded system.This paper formalizes the proposed methodology by using ParametricTemporal Logic. A case study involving two advanced features from theautomotive domain, namely Adaptive Cruise Control and CollisionMitigation is given to demonstrate the methodology.

The control software adapts several control variables tokeep the operational state optimal with respect to multiple objectives.There exist well-known techniques for solving such optimizationproblems. However, current practice shows that the applied techniques,control variables, constraints and related design decisions are notdocumented as a part of the architecture description. Theirimplementation is implicit, tailored for specific characteristics of theembedded system, tightly integrated into and coupled with the controlsoftware, which hinders its reusability, analyzability andmaintainability. This paper presents an architectural framework todesign, document and realize multi-objective optimization in embeddedcontrol software. The framework comprises an architectural styletogether with its visual editor and domain-specific analysis tools, anda code generator. The code generator generates an optimizer modulespecific for the given architecture and it employs aspect-orientedsoftware development techniques to seamlessly integrate this module intothe control software. The effectiveness of the framework is validated inthe context of an industrial case study from the printing systemsdomain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To design a system whichmeets all its quality requirements becomes increasingly difficultbecause of customer demand for new innovative user functions. Methodsand tools are needed to assist the architect during system design.The goal of this paper is to show how metaheuristic optimizationapproaches can improve the process of designing efficient architecturesfor a set of given quality attributes. A case study is conducted inwhich an architecture optimization framework is applied to an existingsub-system in the automotive industry. The case study shows thatmetaheuristic optimization approaches can find efficient solutions forall quality attributes while fulfilling given constraints.By optimizing multiple quality attributes the framework proposesrevolutionary architecture solutions in contrast to human architects,who tend to propose solutions based on previous architectures. Althoughthe case study shows savings in manual effort, it also shows that theproposed architecture solutions should be assessed by the humanarchitect. So, the paper demonstrates how an architecture optimizationframework complements the domain knowledge and experience of thearchitect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Such a system isdataflow (for its description) and time triggered (for its execution).The architecture forms a graph of communicating components, where morethan one path can link two components. Because the characteristics ofthe network and the behavior of intermediate components may vary or areonly partially known, these paths often have different timingcharacteristics, and the flows of information that transit on thesepaths reach their destination at independent times. However, anapplication that seeks consistent values will require these flows to betemporally matched so that a component uses inputs that all (directly orindirectly) depend on the same computation step of another component. Inthis paper, we define this temporal data-matching property, both in astrict sense and in a relaxed way allowing approximately consistentvalues. Then, we show how to analyze a system architecture to detectsituations that result in data-matching inconsistencies. In the contextof multiperiodic systems, where components do not necessarily share acommon period, we also describe an approach to manage data matching thatuses queues to delay too fast paths and timestamps to recognizeconsistent data sets.

These new features needto be considered as early as possible in the software development lifecycle. Model driven engineering promotes an intensive use of models andis now widely seen as a solution to master the development of complexsystems such as embedded ones. Component-based software engineering isanother major trend that gains acceptance in the embedded world becauseof its properties such as reuse, modularity, and flexibility. Thisarticle proposes the Flex-eWare component model (FCM) for designing andimplementing modern embedded systems. The FCM unifies model drivenengineering and component-based software engineering and has beenevaluated in several application domains with different requirements:wireless sensor networks, distributed client/server applications, andcontrol systems for electrical devices. This approach highlights a newconcept: flexibility points that arise at several stages of thedevelopment process, that is, in the model (design phase), in theexecution platform, and during the execution itself. This flexibilitypoints are captured with model libraries that can extend the FCM.Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \\\\&amp; Sons, Ltd. embedded system; software component; flexibility; model drivenengineering'</li><li>'Automatic library migration for the generation of hardware-in-the-loopmodels Embedded systems are widely used in several applications nowadays. Asthey integrate hard- and software elements, their functionality andreliability are often tested by hardware-in-the-loop methods, in whichthe system under test runs in a simulated environment. Due to the risingcomplexity of the embedded functions, performance limitations andpracticability reasons, the simulations are often specialized to testspecific aspects of the embedded system and develop a high diversity bythemselves. This diversity is difficult to manage for a user and resultsin erroneously selected test components and compatibility problems inthe test configuration. This paper presents a generative programmingapproach that handles the diversity of test libraries. Compatibilityissues are explicitly evaluated by a new interface concept. Furthermore,a novel model analyzer facilitates the efficient application in practiceby migrating existing libraries. The approach is evaluated for anexample from the automotive domain using MATLAB/Simulink. (C) 2010Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules. This yields an effective and cost-efficient approach tocompositional synchronous modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployedRemora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligibleCPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. wireless sensor networks; high-level programming; component model;event-driven'</li><li>'Reconfiguration of Distributed Embedded-Control Systems This paper deals with distributed multiagent reconfigurableembedded-control systems following the component-based InternationalIndustrial Standard IEC61499 in which a function block (FB) is anevent-triggered software component owning data and a control applicationis a distributed network of FBs.

To alleviate the burden on students in the roboticscurriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform onembedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has beendeveloped and fabricated as a supplement for these students. Thisgeneral-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial trainingkits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has beenbrought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and C/OS-II suchthat it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition tolinking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, userscan program the codes not only in C language, but also through visualprogramming by means of a graphic interface developed along with theplatform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot functiondesign. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping inrobotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated withthe platform has been designed and used in classes.

Nowadays, limited relatedworks have been proposed to address particular cases of reconfigurationswithout considering distributed architectures. Our first problem is tobe able to handle all possible forms of reconfigurations that can beapplied at run-time to distributed Function Blocks. In this case, acoordination between devices of the execution environment should beapplied to guarantee safe and coherent distributed reconfigurations. Asecond problem is to find the sufficient solutions for the correctimplementation of this reconfigurable distributed architecture.Objective: The paper defines an implementable multi-agent architecturefor automatic and coherent reconfigurations of distributed FunctionBlocks.Method: To address all possible industrial forms, we classify thereconfiguration scenarios into three levels. The first level deals withadditions-removals of Function Blocks to-from the system\\'simplementation. The second deals with updates of compositions of blocks,and the third deals with updates of data. We define a ReconfigurationAgent for each device of the execution environment, and a uniqueCoordination Agent for coordinations between devices. EachReconfiguration Agent to be modelled by nested state machines applieslocal reconfiguration scenarios in the corresponding device aftercoordinations with the Coordination Agent. We propose an Inter-AgentsCommunication Protocol to support correct and coherent reconfigurationsof distributed devices. This protocol is based on Coordination Matricesto be handled by the Coordination Agent in order to define allreconfiguration scenarios that should be simultaneously applied indistributed devices. We propose XML-based implementations for both kindsof agents where XML code blocks are exchanged between devices toguarantee safety distributed reconfigurations. The contributions of thepaper are applied to two Benchmark Production Systems available in ourresearch laboratory.Results: The communication protocol is successfully applied to ourplatforms where simulations are executed to check distributed andcoherent reconfiguration scenarios. The Reconfiguration and CoordinationAgents are implemented in this platform by following the InternationalStandard IEC61499. We show in addition XML-based successful interactionsbetween devices when distributed reconfigurations are applied.Conclusion: The paper successfully defines a multi-agent architecturefor IEC61499 distributed reconfigurable embedded systems whereCoordination and Reconfiguration agents are proposed to allow feasibleand coherent distributed reconfigurations by using a definedcommunication protocol.

Although there havebeen pioneering efforts in applying componentization tosystems-building, these efforts have tended to target specificapplication domains (e. g., embedded systems, operating systems,communications systems, programmable networking environments, ormiddleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantageof this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity andabstraction potential of the component approach. In this article, weargue for the benefits and feasibility of a generic yet tailorableapproach to component-based systems-building that offers a uniformprogramming model that is applicable in a wide range of systems-orientedtarget domains and deployment environments. The component model, calledOpenCom, is supported by a reflective runtime architecture that isitself built from components.

Embeddedsystems are pervasive and often mission-critical, therefore, they mustbe highly trustworthy. Trustworthy embedded systems require extensiveverification. The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions ofbottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verificationcomplexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verificationreuse. Case studies on a suite of networked sensors have shown that ourapproach facilitates major verification reuse and leads toorder-of-magnitude reduction on verification complexity.

At the same time,microkernel-based operating systems are being used to increase thereliability and trustworthiness of embedded systems. Since themicrokernel approach to designing systems is partially based on thecomponentisation of system services, component-based softwareengineering is a particularly attractive approach to developingmicrokernel-based systems. While a number of widely used componentarchitectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprisecomputing rather than embedded systems. Due to the uniquecharacteristics of embedded systems, a component architecture forembedded systems must have low overhead, be able to address relevantnon-functional issues, and be flexible to accommodate applicationspecific requirements. In this paper we introduce a componentarchitecture aimed at the development of microkernel-based embeddedsystems. The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible. We have implemented a prototype of this architecture andconfirm that it has very low overhead and is suitable for implementingboth system-level and application level services.

At the same time, the systemsmust fulfill strict requirements on reliability and correctness.This paper proposes a formal verification methodology which smoothlyintegrates with component-based system-level design using a divide andconquer approach. The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component. Themethodology verifies the correctness of the glue logic inserted betweenthe components and the interaction of the components through the gluelogic. Each such glue logic is verified one at a time using modelchecking techniques.Experimental results have shown the efficiency of the proposedmethodology and demonstrated that it is feasible to apply such averification methodology on real-life examples. formal verification; petri-nets; components; iP; model checking;embedded systems; real-time systems'</li><li>'BOTS: A constraint-based component system for synthesizing scalablesoftware systems Embedded application developers create applications for a wide range ofdevices with different resource constraints. Developers want to maximizethe use of the limited resources available on the device while still notexceeding the capabilities of the device.

In this paper, wepresent a software engineering methodology that automatically scalessoftware to different platforms. We intend to have the applicationdeveloper write high level functional specifications of his software andhave tools that automatically scale the underlying runtime. These toolswill use the functional and non-functional constraints of both thehardware and client application to produce an appropriate runtime.

Model-based technologies help address theseissues by enabling design-time analysis, and providing the means toautomate the development, deployment, configuration, and integration ofcomponent-based DRE systems. To this end, this paper applies modelchecking techniques to DRE design models using model transformations toverify key QoS properties of component-based DRE systems developed usingReal-time CORBA. We introduce a formal semantic domain for a generalclass of DRE systems that enables the verification of distributednon-preemptive real-time scheduling.

However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints. We use amulti-objective concept to model the composition analysis problem anduse an evolutionary algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal solutionsefficiently. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem. We bring forth anumber of issues related to the automation of reusable IP compositionincluding type- compatibility checking, split-programming, andintrospective composition environment, and demonstrate their utilitythrough design examples. hardware/software co-design; system-on-chip; embedded systems; hardwaredescription language (HDL); modeling; simulation; design reuse;interface design'</li><li>'On efficient program synthesis from statecharts Program synthesis from hierarchical state diagrams has for long beendiscussed in various communities.

The viewpoint of the use case modelthat views a system as a black box focuses on descriptions of externalinteractions between the system and related environments. However, forembedded systems that do not disclose most implementation logics outsidethe system, black box-based use case models may experience the drawbackthat considerable information that must be defined for systemdevelopments is omitted. To solve this shortcoming, several studies havebeen proposed on the use of kind of white box technique in which thedynamic behaviors of embedded systems are defined first using a statediagram and the results are reflected in the requirement specifications.However, white box-based modeling has not been widely adopted bydevelopers due to tasks that require a lot of time in the requirementanalysis phase in the initial phase of the software development lifecycle. This study proposes a gray box-based requirement specificationmethod as a trade-off between two contradictory elements (the amount ofinformation required to develop an embedded system and the cost of theeffort required during the requirement analysis phase) in terms of thetwo approaches, the black and the white box-based models. The proposedmethod suggests that an appropriate depth level of embedded systemmodeling is required to define the requirements. This study alsoproposes a mechanism that automatically generates an applicationprogramming interface for each component based on the created model.

However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication.

As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess.

Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in \\{{[}\\}1{]}). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself.

These components need to interact in atimely fashion to achieve the system level end-to-end requirements. Inpractice, the component level timing specification consists of designattributes like component task mapping, task period and scheduledefinition but often lack details on their real-time (functional)requirements. As we observe, there is no systematic methodology in placefor decomposing the feature level timing requirements into componentlevel timing requirements. This paper proposes an early stagetime-budgeting methodology to bridge the above gap. A salient proposalof this methodology is to consider parameterized componenttiming-requirements. A key step in the methodology involves computing aset of constraints by relating component requirements with featurerequirements. This enables the separation of timing constraints fromfunctionality decomposition, and facilitates early optimization of thecomponent time-budget for a complex component based embedded system.This paper formalizes the proposed methodology by using ParametricTemporal Logic.

Such a system isdataflow (for its description) and time triggered (for its execution).The architecture forms a graph of communicating components, where morethan one path can link two components. Because the characteristics ofthe network and the behavior of intermediate components may vary or areonly partially known, these paths often have different timingcharacteristics, and the flows of information that transit on thesepaths reach their destination at independent times. However, anapplication that seeks consistent values will require these flows to betemporally matched so that a component uses inputs that all (directly orindirectly) depend on the same computation step of another component. Inthis paper, we define this temporal data-matching property, both in astrict sense and in a relaxed way allowing approximately consistentvalues. Then, we show how to analyze a system architecture to detectsituations that result in data-matching inconsistencies. In the contextof multiperiodic systems, where components do not necessarily share acommon period, we also describe an approach to manage data matching thatuses queues to delay too fast paths and timestamps to recognizeconsistent data sets.

In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules.

The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application.

The first level deals withadditions-removals of Function Blocks to-from the system\\textbackslash{}'simplementation. The second deals with updates of compositions of blocks,and the third deals with updates of data. We define a ReconfigurationAgent for each device of the execution environment, and a uniqueCoordination Agent for coordinations between devices. EachReconfiguration Agent to be modelled by nested state machines applieslocal reconfiguration scenarios in the corresponding device aftercoordinations with the Coordination Agent. We propose an Inter-AgentsCommunication Protocol to support correct and coherent reconfigurationsof distributed devices. This protocol is based on Coordination Matricesto be handled by the Coordination Agent in order to define allreconfiguration scenarios that should be simultaneously applied indistributed devices. We propose XML-based implementations for both kindsof agents where XML code blocks are exchanged between devices toguarantee safety distributed reconfigurations. The contributions of thepaper are applied to two Benchmark Production Systems available in ourresearch laboratory.Results: The communication protocol is successfully applied to ourplatforms where simulations are executed to check distributed andcoherent reconfiguration scenarios. The Reconfiguration and CoordinationAgents are implemented in this platform by following the InternationalStandard IEC61499. We show in addition XML-based successful interactionsbetween devices when distributed reconfigurations are applied.Conclusion: The paper successfully defines a multi-agent architecturefor IEC61499 distributed reconfigurable embedded systems whereCoordination and Reconfiguration agents are proposed to allow feasibleand coherent distributed reconfigurations by using a definedcommunication protocol.

Although there havebeen pioneering efforts in applying componentization tosystems-building, these efforts have tended to target specificapplication domains (e. g., embedded systems, operating systems,communications systems, programmable networking environments, ormiddleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantageof this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity andabstraction potential of the component approach.

A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations.

'Software Requirement Specification Based on a Gray Box for EmbeddedSystems: A Case Study of a Mobile Phone Camera Sensor Controller One of the most widely used models for specifying functionalrequirements is a use case model. The viewpoint of the use case modelthat views a system as a black box focuses on descriptions of externalinteractions between the system and related environments. However, forembedded systems that do not disclose most implementation logics outsidethe system, black box-based use case models may experience the drawbackthat considerable information that must be defined for systemdevelopments is omitted. To solve this shortcoming, several studies havebeen proposed on the use of kind of white box technique in which thedynamic behaviors of embedded systems are defined first using a statediagram and the results are reflected in the requirement specifications.However, white box-based modeling has not been widely adopted bydevelopers due to tasks that require a lot of time in the requirementanalysis phase in the initial phase of the software development lifecycle. This study proposes a gray box-based requirement specificationmethod as a trade-off between two contradictory elements (the amount ofinformation required to develop an embedded system and the cost of theeffort required during the requirement analysis phase) in terms of thetwo approaches, the black and the white box-based models. The proposedmethod suggests that an appropriate depth level of embedded systemmodeling is required to define the requirements. This study alsoproposes a mechanism that automatically generates an applicationprogramming interface for each component based on the created model.

'Automatic synthesis of communication and concurrency for exploringcomponent-based system implementations considering UML channel semantics Nowadays, multi-processor systems play a critical role in embeddedsystem engineering. As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess.

'Contracts-refinement proof system for component-based embedded systems Contract-based design is an emerging paradigm for the design of complexsystems, where each component is associated with a contract, i.e., aclear description of the expected interaction of the component with itsenvironment. Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in {[}1]). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one.

Inpractice, the component level timing specification consists of designattributes like component task mapping, task period and scheduledefinition but often lack details on their real-time (functional)requirements.

'Analysis of distributed multiperiodic systems to achieve consistent datamatching The distributed real-time architecture of an embedded system is oftendescribed as a set of communicating components. Such a system isdataflow (for its description) and time triggered (for its execution).The architecture forms a graph of communicating components, where morethan one path can link two components. Because the characteristics ofthe network and the behavior of intermediate components may vary or areonly partially known, these paths often have different timingcharacteristics, and the flows of information that transit on thesepaths reach their destination at independent times. However, anapplication that seeks consistent values will require these flows to betemporally matched so that a component uses inputs that all (directly orindirectly) depend on the same computation step of another component. Inthis paper, we define this temporal data-matching property, both in astrict sense and in a relaxed way allowing approximately consistentvalues. Then, we show how to analyze a system architecture to detectsituations that result in data-matching inconsistencies. In the contextof multiperiodic systems, where components do not necessarily share acommon period, we also describe an approach to manage data matching thatuses queues to delay too fast paths and timestamps to recognizeconsistent data sets.

'Compositional design of isochronous systems The synchronous modeling paradigm provides strong correctness guaranteesfor embedded system design while requiring minimal environmentalassumptions. In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules. This yields an effective and cost-efficient approach tocompositional synchronous modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

'A Generic Component-Based Approach for Programming, Composing and TuningSensor Software Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being extensively deployed today invarious monitoring and control applications by enabling rapiddeployments at low cost and with high flexibility. However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployedRemora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligibleCPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. wireless sensor networks; high-level programming; component model;event-driven'\n",

To alleviate the burden on students in the roboticscurriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform onembedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has beendeveloped and fabricated as a supplement for these students. Thisgeneral-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial trainingkits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has beenbrought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and C/OS-II suchthat it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition tolinking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, userscan program the codes not only in C language, but also through visualprogramming by means of a graphic interface developed along with theplatform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot functiondesign. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping inrobotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated withthe platform has been designed and used in classes.

Nowadays, limited relatedworks have been proposed to address particular cases of reconfigurationswithout considering distributed architectures. Our first problem is tobe able to handle all possible forms of reconfigurations that can beapplied at run-time to distributed Function Blocks. In this case, acoordination between devices of the execution environment should beapplied to guarantee safe and coherent distributed reconfigurations. Asecond problem is to find the sufficient solutions for the correctimplementation of this reconfigurable distributed architecture.Objective: The paper defines an implementable multi-agent architecturefor automatic and coherent reconfigurations of distributed FunctionBlocks.Method: To address all possible industrial forms, we classify thereconfiguration scenarios into three levels. The first level deals withadditions-removals of Function Blocks to-from the system\\'simplementation. The second deals with updates of compositions of blocks,and the third deals with updates of data. We define a ReconfigurationAgent for each device of the execution environment, and a uniqueCoordination Agent for coordinations between devices. EachReconfiguration Agent to be modelled by nested state machines applieslocal reconfiguration scenarios in the corresponding device aftercoordinations with the Coordination Agent. We propose an Inter-AgentsCommunication Protocol to support correct and coherent reconfigurationsof distributed devices. This protocol is based on Coordination Matricesto be handled by the Coordination Agent in order to define allreconfiguration scenarios that should be simultaneously applied indistributed devices. We propose XML-based implementations for both kindsof agents where XML code blocks are exchanged between devices toguarantee safety distributed reconfigurations. The contributions of thepaper are applied to two Benchmark Production Systems available in ourresearch laboratory.Results: The communication protocol is successfully applied to ourplatforms where simulations are executed to check distributed andcoherent reconfiguration scenarios. The Reconfiguration and CoordinationAgents are implemented in this platform by following the InternationalStandard IEC61499. We show in addition XML-based successful interactionsbetween devices when distributed reconfigurations are applied.Conclusion: The paper successfully defines a multi-agent architecturefor IEC61499 distributed reconfigurable embedded systems whereCoordination and Reconfiguration agents are proposed to allow feasibleand coherent distributed reconfigurations by using a definedcommunication protocol.

'A generic component model for building systems software Component-based software structuring principles are now commonplace atthe application level; but componentization is far less established whenit comes to building low-level systems software. Although there havebeen pioneering efforts in applying componentization tosystems-building, these efforts have tended to target specificapplication domains (e. g., embedded systems, operating systems,communications systems, programmable networking environments, ormiddleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantageof this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity andabstraction potential of the component approach. In this article, weargue for the benefits and feasibility of a generic yet tailorableapproach to component-based systems-building that offers a uniformprogramming model that is applicable in a wide range of systems-orientedtarget domains and deployment environments.

'Component-based hardware/software co-verification for buildingtrustworthy embedded systems We present a novel component-based approach to hardware/softwareco-verification of embedded systems using model checking. Embeddedsystems are pervasive and often mission-critical, therefore, they mustbe highly trustworthy. Trustworthy embedded systems require extensiveverification. The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions ofbottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verificationcomplexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verificationreuse. Case studies on a suite of networked sensors have shown that ourapproach facilitates major verification reuse and leads toorder-of-magnitude reduction on verification complexity.

Since themicrokernel approach to designing systems is partially based on thecomponentisation of system services, component-based softwareengineering is a particularly attractive approach to developingmicrokernel-based systems. While a number of widely used componentarchitectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprisecomputing rather than embedded systems. Due to the uniquecharacteristics of embedded systems, a component architecture forembedded systems must have low overhead, be able to address relevantnon-functional issues, and be flexible to accommodate applicationspecific requirements. In this paper we introduce a componentarchitecture aimed at the development of microkernel-based embeddedsystems. The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible. We have implemented a prototype of this architecture andconfirm that it has very low overhead and is suitable for implementingboth system-level and application level services.

'Formal verification of component-based designs Embedded systems are becoming increasingly common in our everyday lives.As technology progresses, these systems become more and more complex,and designers handle this increasing complexity by reusing existingcomponents (Intellectual Property blocks). At the same time, the systemsmust fulfill strict requirements on reliability and correctness.This paper proposes a formal verification methodology which smoothlyintegrates with component-based system-level design using a divide andconquer approach. The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component. Themethodology verifies the correctness of the glue logic inserted betweenthe components and the interaction of the components through the gluelogic. Each such glue logic is verified one at a time using modelchecking techniques.Experimental results have shown the efficiency of the proposedmethodology and demonstrated that it is feasible to apply such averification methodology on real-life examples. formal verification; petri-nets; components; iP; model checking;embedded systems; real-time systems'\n",

However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints.

It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem.

The viewpoint of the use case modelthat views a system as a black box focuses on descriptions of externalinteractions between the system and related environments. However, forembedded systems that do not disclose most implementation logics outsidethe system, black box-based use case models may experience the drawbackthat considerable information that must be defined for systemdevelopments is omitted. To solve this shortcoming, several studies havebeen proposed on the use of kind of white box technique in which thedynamic behaviors of embedded systems are defined first using a statediagram and the results are reflected in the requirement specifications.However, white box-based modeling has not been widely adopted bydevelopers due to tasks that require a lot of time in the requirementanalysis phase in the initial phase of the software development lifecycle. This study proposes a gray box-based requirement specificationmethod as a trade-off between two contradictory elements (the amount ofinformation required to develop an embedded system and the cost of theeffort required during the requirement analysis phase) in terms of thetwo approaches, the black and the white box-based models. The proposedmethod suggests that an appropriate depth level of embedded systemmodeling is required to define the requirements. This study alsoproposes a mechanism that automatically generates an applicationprogramming interface for each component based on the created model.

       " [3] \"Failure analysis of AC motor drives via FPGA-based hardware-in-the-loopsimulations The paper deals with an extensive analysis of power converters failuresin AC motor drives by exploiting the capability of ahardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation platform to emulate the real-timebehavior of electrical machines and power converters. In this way it ispossible to investigate the effects of power converter faults inelectrical drives with the aim to propose solutions that allow to reducethe periods of drives inoperability. In this paper, a suitablerealization of a test bench combining an embedded system based on a FPGAboard with a high-level graphical programming language is proposed toreplace part of the electrical drive hardware. Differently than standardapproaches for FPGA programming, which are normally based on hardwaredescription languages, the proposed solution exploits an environmentsoftware platform with a high level of abstraction that leads to a goodtrade-off between accuracy and hardware resources, also allowing afaster prototyping procedure. The proposed HIL solution has been used tostudy some common faults occurring in power converters, evaluating thebehavior of a standard drive operating with different controlalgorithms.

       " [4] \"Formal Model-Based Synthesis of Application-Specific Static RTOS In an embedded system, the specialization of the code of the real-timeoperating system (RTOS) according to the requirements of the applicationallows one to remove unused services and other sources of dead code fromthe binary program. The typical specialization process is based on a mixof precompiler macros and build scripts, both of which are known forbeing sources of errors.In this article, we present a new model-based approach to the design ofapplication-specific RTOS. Starting with finite state models describingthe RTOS and the application requirements, the set of blocks in the RTOScode actually used by the application is automatically computed. Thisset is used to build an application-specific RTOS model. This model isfed into a code generator to produce the source code of anapplication-specific RTOS. It is also used to carry on model-basedvalidations and verifications, including the formal verification thatthe specialization process did not introduce unwanted behaviors orsuppress expected ones.To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, it is applied tospecialize Trampoline, an open-source implementation of the AUTOSAR OSstandard, to an industrial case study from the automotive domain.

       " [5] \"Component-Based Synthesis of Embedded Systems Using SatisfiabilityModulo Theories Constraint programming solvers, such as Satisfiability Modulo Theory(SMT) solvers, are capable tools in finding preferable configurationsfor embedded systems from large design spaces. However, constructing SMTconstraint programs is not trivial, in particular for complex systemsthat exhibit multiple viewpoints and models. In this article we proposeCoDeL: a component-based description language that allows systemdesigners to express components as reusable building blocks of thesystem with their parameterizable properties, models, andinterconnectivity. Systems are synthesized by allocating, connecting,and parameterizing the components to satisfy the requirements of anapplication. We present an algorithm that transforms component-baseddesign spaces, expressible in CoDeL, to an SMT program, which, solved bystate-of-the-art SMT solvers, determines the satisfiability of thesynthesis problem, and delivers a correct-by-construction systemconfiguration. Evaluation results for use cases in the domain ofscheduling and mapping of distributed real-time processes confirm,first, the performance gain of SMT compared to traditional design spaceexploration approaches, second, the usability gains by expressing designproblems in CoDeL, and third, the capability of the CoDeL/SMT approachto support the design of embedded systems.

       " [6] \"Automatic synthesis of communication and concurrency for exploringcomponent-based system implementations considering UML channel semantics Nowadays, multi-processor systems play a critical role in embeddedsystem engineering. As a result, the generation of optimal concurrentimplementations is an unavoidable but difficult task. Correct concurrentcodes achieving maximum performance on the target platform are hard toobtain. On the one hand, dependencies on concurrent computations, suchas shared variables or synchronizations, are extremely difficult toanalyze from source code. On the other hand, it is completely unfeasiblefor designers to manually generate multiple implementations in order toevaluate and compare all the possible design alternatives. To overcomethese limitations, this paper presents an automatic code generationapproach focusing on communication channel semantics. The approachproposes the use of UML/MARTE models to enable designers to graphicallyhandle dependencies and concurrency of the models. As a result, theautomatic generation process enables multiple design alternatives to beeasily obtained and evaluated without adding manual effort to the designprocess. To demonstrate these capabilities, the methodology is testedwith two large examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

       " [7] \"DREMS ML: A wide spectrum architecture design language for distributedcomputing platforms Complex sensing, processing and control applications running ondistributed platforms are difficult to design, develop, analyze,integrate, deploy and operate, especially if resource constraints, faulttolerance and security issues are to be addressed. While technologyexists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-basedapplications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools.Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very fewexisting and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution todevelopers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integratedmodel-driven development environment that addresses all phases ofapplication lifecycle including design, development, verification,analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, withsupporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such amodel-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, thispaper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMSML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specificsub-languages. We claim that the language promotes``correct-by-construction{''} software development and integration bysupporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle. Using acase study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS ML impacts thedevelopment of embedded systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

       " [8] \"Contracts-refinement proof system for component-based embedded systems Contract-based design is an emerging paradigm for the design of complexsystems, where each component is associated with a contract, i.e., aclear description of the expected interaction of the component with itsenvironment. Contracts specify the expected behavior of a component bydefining the assumptions that must be satisfied by the environment andthe guarantees satisfied by the component in response. The ultimate goalof contract-based design is to allow for compositional reasoning,stepwise refinement, and a principled reuse of components that arealready pre-designed, or designed independently.In this paper, we present fully formal contract framework based ontemporal logic (a preliminary version of this framework has beenpresented in {[}1]). The synchronous or asynchronous decomposition of acomponent into subcomponents is complemented with the correspondingrefinement of its contracts. The framework exploits such decompositionto automatically generate a set of proof obligations. Once verified, theconditions allow concluding the correctness of the architecture. Thismeans that the components ensure the guarantee of the system and thesystem ensures the assumptions of the components. The framework can beinstantiated with different temporal logics. The proof system reducesthe correctness of contracts refinement to entailment of temporal logicformulas. The tool support relies on an expressive propertyspecification language, conceived for the formalization of embeddedsystem requirements, and on a verification engine based on automated SMTtechniques.

       " [9] \"Hardware Acceleration of Red-Black Tree Management and Application toJust-In-Time Compilation Due to the everlasting consumer demand for more complex applications,embedded systems have evolved both in terms of complexity andheterogeneity. The architecture of such systems often includes severalkinds of different computing resources (DSPs, GPUs, etc.). As aconsequence, software designers are facing significant performance andportability issues to target these devices. Software relies more andmore on virtualization technologies to maximize portability ofapplications. In order to balance portability and performance, mostvirtualization technologies leverage Just-in-time (JIT) compilation toprovide runtime optimized code from portable one. Nevertheless, theefficiency of JIT compilation depends on the ability to compensate itsoverhead with execution speedups of generated code. While most researchefforts focus on limiting overhead of JIT compilation phases by reducingtheir occurrences, this paper investigates opportunities of speeding upJIT compilation itself. We first present a performance analysis ofdifferent JIT compilation technologies in order to identify hardware andsoftware optimization opportunities. Second, we propose a solution basedon a dedicated processor with specialized instructions for criticalfunctions of JIT compilers. These specialized instructions provide anaverage 5x speedup on manipulations of associative arrays and dynamicmemory allocation. Based on the LLVM framework, we show a 15\\\\% overallspeedup on code generator's execution time. Because our specializedinstructions are hidden behind standard libraries, we also argue thatthese instructions may be transparently reused for a wider range ofapplications.

       "[10] \"Time-budgeting: a component based development methodology for real-timeembedded systems The design of a complex embedded control system involves integration oflarge number of components. These components need to interact in atimely fashion to achieve the system level end-to-end requirements. Inpractice, the component level timing specification consists of designattributes like component task mapping, task period and scheduledefinition but often lack details on their real-time (functional)requirements. As we observe, there is no systematic methodology in placefor decomposing the feature level timing requirements into componentlevel timing requirements. This paper proposes an early stagetime-budgeting methodology to bridge the above gap. A salient proposalof this methodology is to consider parameterized componenttiming-requirements. A key step in the methodology involves computing aset of constraints by relating component requirements with featurerequirements. This enables the separation of timing constraints fromfunctionality decomposition, and facilitates early optimization of thecomponent time-budget for a complex component based embedded system.This paper formalizes the proposed methodology by using ParametricTemporal Logic. A case study involving two advanced features from theautomotive domain, namely Adaptive Cruise Control and CollisionMitigation is given to demonstrate the methodology.

       "[13] \"Analysis of distributed multiperiodic systems to achieve consistent datamatching The distributed real-time architecture of an embedded system is oftendescribed as a set of communicating components. Such a system isdataflow (for its description) and time triggered (for its execution).The architecture forms a graph of communicating components, where morethan one path can link two components. Because the characteristics ofthe network and the behavior of intermediate components may vary or areonly partially known, these paths often have different timingcharacteristics, and the flows of information that transit on thesepaths reach their destination at independent times. However, anapplication that seeks consistent values will require these flows to betemporally matched so that a component uses inputs that all (directly orindirectly) depend on the same computation step of another component. Inthis paper, we define this temporal data-matching property, both in astrict sense and in a relaxed way allowing approximately consistentvalues. Then, we show how to analyze a system architecture to detectsituations that result in data-matching inconsistencies. In the contextof multiperiodic systems, where components do not necessarily share acommon period, we also describe an approach to manage data matching thatuses queues to delay too fast paths and timestamps to recognizeconsistent data sets.

       "[15] \"Flex-eWare: a flexible model driven solution for designing andimplementing embedded distributed systems The complexity of modern embedded systems increases as they incorporatenew concerns such as distribution and mobility. These new features needto be considered as early as possible in the software development lifecycle. Model driven engineering promotes an intensive use of models andis now widely seen as a solution to master the development of complexsystems such as embedded ones. Component-based software engineering isanother major trend that gains acceptance in the embedded world becauseof its properties such as reuse, modularity, and flexibility. Thisarticle proposes the Flex-eWare component model (FCM) for designing andimplementing modern embedded systems. The FCM unifies model drivenengineering and component-based software engineering and has beenevaluated in several application domains with different requirements:wireless sensor networks, distributed client/server applications, andcontrol systems for electrical devices. This approach highlights a newconcept: flexibility points that arise at several stages of thedevelopment process, that is, in the model (design phase), in theexecution platform, and during the execution itself. This flexibilitypoints are captured with model libraries that can extend the FCM.Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \\\\& Sons, Ltd. embedded system; software component; flexibility; model drivenengineering\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "[16] \"Automatic library migration for the generation of hardware-in-the-loopmodels Embedded systems are widely used in several applications nowadays. Asthey integrate hard- and software elements, their functionality andreliability are often tested by hardware-in-the-loop methods, in whichthe system under test runs in a simulated environment. Due to the risingcomplexity of the embedded functions, performance limitations andpracticability reasons, the simulations are often specialized to testspecific aspects of the embedded system and develop a high diversity bythemselves. This diversity is difficult to manage for a user and resultsin erroneously selected test components and compatibility problems inthe test configuration. This paper presents a generative programmingapproach that handles the diversity of test libraries. Compatibilityissues are explicitly evaluated by a new interface concept.

       "[17] \"Compositional design of isochronous systems The synchronous modeling paradigm provides strong correctness guaranteesfor embedded system design while requiring minimal environmentalassumptions. In most related frameworks, global execution correctness isachieved by ensuring the insensitivity of (logical) time in the programfrom (real) time in the environment. This property, called endochrony orpatience, can be statically checked, making it fast to ensure designcorrectness. Unfortunately, it is not preserved by composition, whichmakes it difficult to exploit with component-based design concepts inmind. Compositionality can be achieved by weakening this objective, butat the cost of an exhaustive state-space exploration. This raises atrade-off between performance and precision. Our aim is to balance it byproposing a formal design methodology that adheres to a weakened globaldesign objective: the non-blocking composition of weakly endochronousprocesses, while preserving local design objectives for synchronousmodules. This yields an effective and cost-efficient approach tocompositional synchronous modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

       "[18] \"A Generic Component-Based Approach for Programming, Composing and TuningSensor Software Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being extensively deployed today invarious monitoring and control applications by enabling rapiddeployments at low cost and with high flexibility. However, high-levelsoftware development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spreadWSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNsis heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, codewell-structuring, degree of code reusability, required softwaredevelopment effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for aparticular application. Component-based programming has been recognizedas an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most ofthe componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to variousreasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In thisarticle, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcomethe hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remoraoffers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well withresource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore,the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposalmore practical for embedded applications, which are inherentlyevent-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora andunderlying system software promises a new direction towards separationof concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to developsensor middleware services which should be generic and developed closeto the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization ofsensor software-deploying only application-required system-levelservices on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system softwareimage for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployedRemora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligibleCPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. wireless sensor networks; high-level programming; component model;event-driven\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "[20] \"Rapid Prototyping Platform for Robotics Applications For the past several years, a team in the Department of ElectricalEngineering (EE), National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan, has beenestablishing a pedagogical approach to embody embedded systems in thecontext of robotics. To alleviate the burden on students in the roboticscurriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform onembedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has beendeveloped and fabricated as a supplement for these students. Thisgeneral-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial trainingkits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has beenbrought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and C/OS-II suchthat it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition tolinking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, userscan program the codes not only in C language, but also through visualprogramming by means of a graphic interface developed along with theplatform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot functiondesign. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping inrobotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated withthe platform has been designed and used in classes. Based on assessmentsand evaluation on the students who have completed this course, thecurricular training is satisfactory and largely meets the requirementsestablished at the design stage.

       "[21] \"Intelligent distributed control systems Context: The paper(2) deals with distributed reconfigurable embeddedcontrol systems following the component-based International IndustrialStandard IEC61499 in which a Function Block (abbreviated by FB) is anevent-triggered software component owning data and a control applicationis a distributed network of Function Blocks. Nowadays, limited relatedworks have been proposed to address particular cases of reconfigurationswithout considering distributed architectures. Our first problem is tobe able to handle all possible forms of reconfigurations that can beapplied at run-time to distributed Function Blocks. In this case, acoordination between devices of the execution environment should beapplied to guarantee safe and coherent distributed reconfigurations. Asecond problem is to find the sufficient solutions for the correctimplementation of this reconfigurable distributed architecture.Objective: The paper defines an implementable multi-agent architecturefor automatic and coherent reconfigurations of distributed FunctionBlocks.Method: To address all possible industrial forms, we classify thereconfiguration scenarios into three levels. The first level deals withadditions-removals of Function Blocks to-from the system'simplementation. The second deals with updates of compositions of blocks,and the third deals with updates of data. We define a ReconfigurationAgent for each device of the execution environment, and a uniqueCoordination Agent for coordinations between devices. EachReconfiguration Agent to be modelled by nested state machines applieslocal reconfiguration scenarios in the corresponding device aftercoordinations with the Coordination Agent. We propose an Inter-AgentsCommunication Protocol to support correct and coherent reconfigurationsof distributed devices. This protocol is based on Coordination Matricesto be handled by the Coordination Agent in order to define allreconfiguration scenarios that should be simultaneously applied indistributed devices. We propose XML-based implementations for both kindsof agents where XML code blocks are exchanged between devices toguarantee safety distributed reconfigurations. The contributions of thepaper are applied to two Benchmark Production Systems available in ourresearch laboratory.Results: The communication protocol is successfully applied to ourplatforms where simulations are executed to check distributed andcoherent reconfiguration scenarios. The Reconfiguration and CoordinationAgents are implemented in this platform by following the InternationalStandard IEC61499. We show in addition XML-based successful interactionsbetween devices when distributed reconfigurations are applied.Conclusion: The paper successfully defines a multi-agent architecturefor IEC61499 distributed reconfigurable embedded systems whereCoordination and Reconfiguration agents are proposed to allow feasibleand coherent distributed reconfigurations by using a definedcommunication protocol. This architecture is implemented in XML andapplied to real industrial platforms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rightsreserved.

       "[23] \"A generic component model for building systems software Component-based software structuring principles are now commonplace atthe application level; but componentization is far less established whenit comes to building low-level systems software. Although there havebeen pioneering efforts in applying componentization tosystems-building, these efforts have tended to target specificapplication domains (e. g., embedded systems, operating systems,communications systems, programmable networking environments, ormiddleware platforms). They also tend to be targeted at specificdeployment environments (e. g., standard personal computer (PC)environments, network processors, or microcontrollers). The disadvantageof this narrow targeting is that it fails to maximize the genericity andabstraction potential of the component approach. In this article, weargue for the benefits and feasibility of a generic yet tailorableapproach to component-based systems-building that offers a uniformprogramming model that is applicable in a wide range of systems-orientedtarget domains and deployment environments. The component model, calledOpenCom, is supported by a reflective runtime architecture that isitself built from components. After describing OpenCom and evaluatingits performance and overhead characteristics, we present and evaluatetwo case studies of systems we have built using OpenCom technology, thusillustrating its benefits and its general applicability. design; standardization; management; component-based software; computersystems implementation\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "[24] \"Component-based hardware/software co-verification for buildingtrustworthy embedded systems We present a novel component-based approach to hardware/softwareco-verification of embedded systems using model checking. Embeddedsystems are pervasive and often mission-critical, therefore, they mustbe highly trustworthy. Trustworthy embedded systems require extensiveverification. The close interactions between hardware and software ofembedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverseapplications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems areincreasingly component-based and include only the necessary componentsfor their missions. In our approach, a component model for embeddedsystems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardwarecomponents) and software components is defined. Hardware and softwarecomponents are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systemsare co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions ofbottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verificationcomplexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verificationreuse. Case studies on a suite of networked sensors have shown that ourapproach facilitates major verification reuse and leads toorder-of-magnitude reduction on verification complexity.

At the same time,microkernel-based operating systems are being used to increase thereliability and trustworthiness of embedded systems. Since themicrokernel approach to designing systems is partially based on thecomponentisation of system services, component-based softwareengineering is a particularly attractive approach to developingmicrokernel-based systems. While a number of widely used componentarchitectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprisecomputing rather than embedded systems. Due to the uniquecharacteristics of embedded systems, a component architecture forembedded systems must have low overhead, be able to address relevantnon-functional issues, and be flexible to accommodate applicationspecific requirements. In this paper we introduce a componentarchitecture aimed at the development of microkernel-based embeddedsystems. The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has aminimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexibleand extensible. We have implemented a prototype of this architecture andconfirm that it has very low overhead and is suitable for implementingboth system-level and application level services.

       "[26] \"Formal verification of component-based designs Embedded systems are becoming increasingly common in our everyday lives.As technology progresses, these systems become more and more complex,and designers handle this increasing complexity by reusing existingcomponents (Intellectual Property blocks). At the same time, the systemsmust fulfill strict requirements on reliability and correctness.This paper proposes a formal verification methodology which smoothlyintegrates with component-based system-level design using a divide andconquer approach. The methodology assumes that the system consists ofseveral reusable components, each of them already formally verified bytheir designers. The components are considered correct given that theenvironment satisfies certain properties imposed by the component.

Model-based technologies help address theseissues by enabling design-time analysis, and providing the means toautomate the development, deployment, configuration, and integration ofcomponent-based DRE systems. To this end, this paper applies modelchecking techniques to DRE design models using model transformations toverify key QoS properties of component-based DRE systems developed usingReal-time CORBA. We introduce a formal semantic domain for a generalclass of DRE systems that enables the verification of distributednon-preemptive real-time scheduling.

       "[29] \"QoS analysis for component-based embedded software: Model andmethodology Component-based development (CBD) techniques have been widely used toenhance the productivity and reduce the cost for software systemsdevelopment. However, applying CBD techniques to embedded softwaredevelopment faces additional challenges. For embedded systems. it iscrucial to consider the quality of service (QoS) attributes, such astimeliness, memory limitations, output precision, and batteryconstraints. Frequently, multiple components implementing the samefunctionality with different QoS properties (measurements in terms ofQoS attributes) can be used to compose a system. Also, softwarecomponents may have parameters that can be configured to satisfydifferent QoS requirements. Composition analysis, which is used todetermine the most suitable component selections and parameter settingsto best satisfy the system QoS requirement, is very important inembedded software development process. In this paper, we present a modeland the methodologies to facilitate composition analysis. We define QoSrequirements as constraints and objectives. Composition analysis isperformed based on the QoS properties and requirements to find solutions(component selections and parameter settings) that can optimize the QoSobjectives while satisfying the QoS constraints. We use amulti-objective concept to model the composition analysis problem anduse an evolutionary algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal solutionsefficiently. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

       "[30] \"BALBOA: A component-based design environment for system models This paper presents the BALBOA component composition framework forsystem-level architectural design. It has three parts: a loosely-typedcomponent integration language (CIL); a set of C++ intellectual property(IP) component libraries; and a set of split-level interfaces (SLIs) tolink the two. A CIL component interface can be mapped to many differentC++ component implementations. A type-inference system maps allweakly-typed CIL interfaces to strongly typed C++ componentimplementations to produce an executable architectural model. Thus, thisamounts to selecting IP implementations according to a set of connectionconstraints. The SLIs are used to select, adapt, and validate theimplementation types. The advantage of using the CIL is that the designdescription sizes are much smaller because the runtime infrastructureautomatically selects the IP and communication implementations. The typeinference facilitates changes by automatically propagating them throughthe design structure. We show that the inference problem is NP completeand we present a heuristic solution to the problem. We bring forth anumber of issues related to the automation of reusable IP compositionincluding type- compatibility checking, split-programming, andintrospective composition environment, and demonstrate their utilitythrough design examples. hardware/software co-design; system-on-chip; embedded systems; hardwaredescription language (HDL); modeling; simulation; design reuse;interface design\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "[31] \"On efficient program synthesis from statecharts Program synthesis from hierarchical state diagrams has for long beendiscussed in various communities. My aim is to provide an efficient,lightweight code generation scheme suitable for resource constrainedmicrocontrollers.I describe an initial implementation of SCOPE-a hierarchical codegenerator for a variant of the statechart language. I shall discussseveral techniques implemented in the tool, namely imposing andexploiting a regular hierarchy structure, labeling schemes for fastancestor queries, improvements in exiting states, compile-time scoperesolution for transitions, and various details of compact runtimerepresentation.The resulting algorithm avoids the exponential code growth exhibited bytools based on flattening of hierarchical state machine. At the sametime it demonstrates that it is possible to maintain reasonable speedand size results even for small models, while preserving the hierarchyat runtime. SCOPE currently produces code that is comparable with thatof industrial tools (IAR visualSTATE) for small models and clearly winsfor bigger ones. algorithms; performance; program synthesis; automatic code generation;statecharts; embedded systems\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "[32] \"Taming heterogeneity the Ptolemy approach Modern embedded computing systems tend to be heterogeneous in the senseof being composed of subsystems with very different characteristics,which communicate and interact in a variety of ways-synchronous orasynchronous, buffered or unbuffered, etc. Obviously, when designingsuch systems, a modeling language needs to reflect this heterogeneity.Today's modeling environments usually offer a variant of what we callamorphous heterogeneity to address this problem. This paper argues thatmodeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyzeinteractions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a morestructured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity,to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semanticframework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses theissues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desirefor component reuse. It introduces the notion of domain polymorphism asa way to address these issues. component-based design; embedded systems; heterogeneous modeling; modelsof computation\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "[33] \"A survey of configurable component-based operating systems for embeddedapplications Component-based software is becoming an increasingly popular technologyas a means for creating complex software systems by assemblingoff-the-shelf building blocks.
