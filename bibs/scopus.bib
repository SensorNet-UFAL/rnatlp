abstract={The use of maker community tools and IoT technologies inside classrooms is spreading to an ever-increasing number of education and science fields. GAIA is a European research project focused on achieving behavior change for sustainability and energy awareness in schools. In this work, we report on how a large IoT deployment in a number of educational buildings and real-world data from this infrastructure, are utilized to support a “maker” lab kit activity inside the classroom. We also provide some insights to the integration of these activities in the school curriculum, along with a discussion on feedback produced through a series of workshop activities in a number of schools in Greece. Moreover, we discuss the application of the lab kit framework towards implementing an interactive installation. We also report on how the lab kit is paired with a serious game and an augmented reality app for smartphones and tablets, supporting the in-class activities. Our initial evaluation results show a very positive first reaction by the school community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Amid the most recent years, gamification has gotten expanding consideration focusing on an assortment of individuals including children, students, youngsters and employers. Likewise, great advances have been also seen in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) triggering various researchers' interest. In this paper, the core integration architecture of the InLife ecosystem that combines IoT with Serious Games is presented, as well as the user portal that can be used from third-party developers to create their own Serious Games. Specifically, the proposed platform focuses on an innovative gamification framework targeting both typical as well as special education and social inclusion activities based on Serious Games. The core concept leverages on the potential of the IoT paradigm to link closely actions, decisions and events happening in real-life with in-game educational progress and modern gaming technologies. This bridge strengthens the infusion of gamification into non-leisure contexts, boosting at the same time the creation of new educational methodologies as well as new business opportunities. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Model-based dependability analysis provides an effective manner to evaluate and design the dependability of critical IT systems by abstracting the system architecture and operations. As the size and the complexity of systems increase, however, the process to compose the dependability model becomes complicated and time-consuming. Improving the efficiency of modeling process is practically an important challenge of dependability engineering. In this paper, we review the techniques for model component reuse that makes dependability model composition and analysis more efficient. In particular, component-based modeling approaches for reliability, availability, maintainability and safety analysis presented in the literature are summarized. In order to effectively apply model component reuse, we advocate the importance of asset-based dependability analysis approach that associates the reusable model components with underlying system development process. Finally, we discuss the necessary extensions of these techniques toward efficient dependability analysis for IoT systems which are significantly affecting real world. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={The Internet of Things mechanisms enable the management of home environments since they can be developed as IoT based information systems. From standard smart homes to automated buildings, including other kind of domotics and inmotics solutions, every system must be tested and validated before its installation. The current tools offered by IoT and home automation vendors lack in emulation features close to the real behavior of the devices. In many cases, delaying the verification actions until the hardware is acquired and installed may cause some drawbacks, for example, from the economic point of view. This paper presents a solution for emulating home automation environments which are based on the KNX standard and can be represented by architectures of devices. The emulation consist of developing virtual implementations of real devices which operate and communicate through web technology. The technology implementing these virtual devices allows us to develop components which can provide different type of data related to the installation (audio, video, text, animations, images, etc.). The architectures can be managed using web services and their behavior can be tested through web user interfaces showing the mentioned data. Furthermore, virtual and physical devices are connected to validate the interoperability between the real installation and the emulation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Agility is a key characteristic in disaster relief operations. Intelligent process-aware information systems (IPAISs) can support agility in disaster relief operations through providing information and process reach and richness to manage dynamic inter-operations. In this research, based on relevant reference architectures, a conceptual overview of an IPAIS to support agility in disaster relief operations is described. This conceptual overview includes the dynamic partnering, the collaborative process composition, the collaborative ontology management, the global workflow engine, the run-time coordination, the dynamic rule management, the run-time process proposer, and the dynamic interoperability adaptor components. Based on this conceptual overview, a systematic literature review is conducted to explore emerging approaches that can be applied to realise intelligent process-centred collaborative inter-operations to respond disasters. The findings of the conducted review show the applicability of the emerging multi-agent service-oriented modelling and analysis approaches, optimal control theory based methodologies, social network analysis techniques, data-driven inductive methods, resilient-centred approaches for robustness and agility, self-organisation mechanisms based on cyber physical systems and systems of systems perspectives, simulation methods, and trust management procedures to support the realisation of the components of an IPAIS in the context of disaster relief operations. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a promising approach for real-time processing of big-data streams originating from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Even though scalability and flexibility are key issues for IoT applications, current studies are mostly based on centralized solutions and restrictive query languages. Moreover, development, deployment and operation of big-data applications require significant amount of technical expertise. Hence, a framework that provides a higher abstraction level programming model and a streamlined execution environment is essential to facilitate widespread user adoption. In this paper, we propose a data-flow based visual programming model that enables development of big-data applications in IoT domain even by users who have limited or no experience in big-data technologies. A scalable CEP engine is also devised to execute the applications developed using this language. A prototype is implemented by using the state-of-the-art big-data and real-time stream processing technologies to evaluate the applicability and usability of the framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a gamification approach as a novel framework for smart building infrastructure with the goal of motivating human occupants to consider personal energy usage and to have positive effects on their environment. Human interaction in the context of cyber-physical systems is a core component and consideration in the implementation of any smart building technology. Research has shown that the adoption of human-centric building services and amenities leads to improvements in the operational efficiency of these cyber-physical systems directed toward controlling building energy usage. We introduce a strategy that incorporates humans-in-the-loop modeling by creating an interface to allow building managers to interact with occupants and potentially incentivize energy efficient behavior. Game theoretic analysis typically relies on the assumption that the utility function of each individual agent is known a priori. Instead, we propose a novel benchmark utility learning framework that employs robust estimations of occupant actions toward energy efficiency. To improve forecasting performance, we extend the benchmark utility learning scheme by leveraging Deep Learning end-to-end training with deep bi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks. We apply the proposed methods to high-dimensional data from a social game experiment designed to encourage energy efficient behavior among smart building occupants. Using data gathered from occupant actions for resources such as room lighting, we forecast patterns of resource usage to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods on ground truth data. The results of our study show that we can achieve a highly accurate representation of the ground truth for occupant resource usage.

abstract={Rapid development and conducted experiments in the field of the introduction the fifth generation of the mobile network standard allow for the flourishing of the Internet of Things. This is one of the most important reasons to design and test systems that can be implemented to increase the quality of our lives. In this paper, we propose a system model for managing tasks in smart homes using multi-agent solutions. The proposed solution organizes work and distributes tasks to individual family members. An additional advantage is the introduction of gamification, not only between household members, but also between families. The solution was tested to simulate the entire solution as well as the individual components that make up the system. The proposal is described with regard to the possibility of implementing smart homes in future projects. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

It can be considered the most important at present due to its ability to make the smart city possible. We also propose the development, deployment and implementation of a mixed IoT architecture LoRa-Sigfox composed of components based on open hardware and software.

abstract={Localization plays a pivotal role in wireless sensor networks. Many range-based localization algorithms have been proposed for 2-D sensor networks or densely deployed 3-D sensor networks. However, range-based localization in sparse 3-D sensor networks is still a challenging problem, because the sparseness of the network makes it difficult to obtain a proper order of nodes to be sequentially localized. The patch-and-stitching localization strategy can conquer the sparseness problem in 2-D networks, but for 3-D networks it is still unknown how to uniquely merge two patches when there are not enough common nodes. In this paper, we solve this challenging problem by deriving the conditions under which two subnetworks can be uniquely merged. In the proposed approach, we treat the translation parameters as unknowns and form a set of equations with which the unknowns can be uniquely solved. The novelty of our algorithm also lies in that we exploit both common nodes and connecting edges among adjacent subnetworks to merge them, resulting in very high chances that two subnetworks can be merged. We conduct extensive simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm could localize more than 90% of nodes in sparse 3-D networks with average node degree of 11 and anchor ratio of 5%, while the best existing solution can localize only 52% of nodes in the same situation. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The competition in this modern world must be followed by novice developers, especially students to improve competitiveness and creativity. But the complexity to make the programs for build IOT applications are difficult for beginner developers. After analyzing the problems and conditions, we need an application that used to simplify text-based programming into visual based programming to make it easy to understand. This paper describes how to control IoT project easily using visual programming with android application over the internet. The application is created by describing the functions of IoT application with Raspberry, then writers made the communication protocol and user interface design based on classification of software construction elements with object modeling in order to be understood by the user. The practical goal of this paper is to continue the previous work from design into usable application, controlling education robot, learn IoT with RaspberryPi, make Bluetooth and internet connection through database, special additional features like conditional programming and monitoring output. The Software User Testing is used to rate the application and the result from the questionnaire with SUS methodology show that the application has a total score of 72,9 out of 100 which means it has an adjective ranking with 'Good' scale, Grade scale in 'C' category and 'Acceptable' in Acceptability scale that conclude this application is accented and easy to use. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) consists in a variety of smart connected objects, among which a category of low-end devices based on micro-controllers. The orchestration of low-end IoT devices is not straightforward because of the lack of generic and holistic solutions articulating cloud-based tools on one hand, and low-end IoT device software on the other hand. In this paper, we describe such a solution, combining a cloud-based IDE, graphical programming, and automatic JavaScript generation. Scripts are pushed over the Internet and over-the-air for the last hop, updating runtime containers hosted on heterogeneous low-end IoT devices running RIOT. We demonstrate a prototype working on common off-the-shelf low-end IoT hardware with as little as 32kB of memory. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The current industrial revolution., known as Industry 4.0, consists of the digitalization of industrial processes and also incorporates the use of 3D printers, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, virtual reality companies, must adapt to these changes. For these reasons, the next generation of Business Engineers must strengthen their technical knowledge and personal skills to face this new digital era. In this work, different learning methods that reinforce soft or social skills focused on Integration, Trust, Communication, and Collaboration (ITC2) are shown to acquire the necessary tools to occupy the jobs and lead this virtual revolution. For this purpose, different methodologies, such as serious games, gamification, simulation and case studies are proposed for the teaching of ITC2 skills in an Engineering course. Significant improvements were made in the students' academic performance and in the continuous use of critical thinking. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={To develop the English learning and communication App platform, the component-based development methods are discussed, which is based on both practical methods and some theories as stated by some researchers across the platform. The Domain engineering or Product line engineering are studied with respect to the App letsvie. Then small components of the task are applied, which can be interfaces, algorithms or even metrics which are fully tested and developed independently. The main purpose is relying more on reusability, which is the use of existing assets, an asset can easily be defined as an object adding value to something. This time we are talking of adding value to a software system. Lastly, the components are built and assembled to create the App system. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as automotive systems, are starting to include sophisticated machine learning (ML) components. Their correctness, therefore, depends on properties of the inner ML modules. While learning algorithms aim to generalize from examples, they are only as good as the examples provided, and recent efforts have shown that they can produce inconsistent output under small adversarial perturbations. This raises the question: can the output from learning components lead to a failure of the entire CPS? In this work, we address this question by formulating it as a problem of falsifying signal temporal logic specifications for CPS with ML components. We propose a compositional falsification framework where a temporal logic falsifier and a machine learning analyzer cooperate with the aim of finding falsifying executions of the considered model. The efficacy of the proposed technique is shown on an automatic emergency braking system model with a perception component based on deep neural networks. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Because of nowadays complex and highly automated industrial production lines, every stoppage involves the danger of a massive economic harm. That’s why companies use already various production, quality and maintenance methods to reduce—or at least to handle—unforeseen stoppages. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the reliability of production fields by supporting predictive maintenance under the combination of systems from energy and maintenance management. Wireless sensor networks and mobile devices are integrated into a cyber-physical system to gain real-time transparency of energy demands within production environments. Being aware of challenges introducing cyber-physical systems into the brownfield, the proposed solution considers needs of data standardisations, IT security, staff participation, big data handling, long-term technical risk and cost-benefit estimations. The developed methods are considered by user-oriented design principles to deliver role-specific information. Therefore, the derivation of these informational requirements is based on production unique job activities. Allocating time and component-based energy demands whilst taking machine and environmental conditions into account enables a basis of comparison and a continuous improvement process of energy efficiency and maintenance. These demands are fulfilled by the methods of a continuous energy value stream mapping, an energy efficiency tracker and an integrating energy and maintenance monitoring. This proposed approach is based on the ESIMA project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The project aims for “Optimised resource efficiency in production through energy autarkic sensors and interaction with mobile users”. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The behavioral analysis of cyber-physical systems in safety-critical scenarios is a challenging task. In this paper, the endogenous and exogenous aspects of resilience are of cornerstone importance in system design and verification. Endogenous resilience is the inherent ability of the system to detect and process internal faults and malicious attacks. Exogenous resilience is the permanent capability of the system to maintain a safe operation within its ambient environment. In this paper, we present a predictive dual-sided contract-based formal methodology to address both aspects of resilience on top of a distributed object-oriented component-based software model. It is illustrated by a case study of urban drone rescue systems. We exploit the formalism of timed automat a and the toolbox UPPAAL to predict by abstraction and analyze (simulate and verify) endogenous resilience. Instead of presenting the final models of the case study, we reflect our experience with UPPAAL in generic patterns of system design and contract specification, reusable in other contexts with adaptations. The analysis of exogenous resilience is specific to the considered drone rescue system. It consists of synthesizing by iterative model-checking safe flight paths for the drones within a 3D virtual model of urban surroundings true to modern cities. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The latest wave of connected digital systems, nowadays called Internet of Things (IoT) promises various gains, especially in terms of significant ease of data access. A large number of different platforms for IoT applications, however, makes their development difficult and time-consuming leading to projects that are failed to be on time, on budget or fully completed. To address the platform heterogeneity, this paper presents the ongoing work on development environment called Orcc-IoT. Orcc-IoT facilitates the development of IoT by combining dataflow modelling language, heterogeneous code generator and the library of ready-made IoT actors. The utilisation of Orcc-IoT in development is expected to increase the quality, and to reduce the development costs and time-to-market of IoT applications.

abstract={Recent advances in sensor network provide more and more equipment with a large amount of sensors and actuators. However, their adoptions in modern life face several challenges. First, sensor network design is complex and requires several steps including network sizing, hardware and software development, deployment, and data exploitation. Often, each step is managed by a particular tool. These tools are rarely connected to each other. Therefore, descriptions are required in each used tool. These multiple descriptions are costly in terms of development time and can lead to design errors. In order to address these issues, we propose a new model-driven framework named Modesene to efficiently design a sensor network for different kind of application. Modesene is designed to ensure four main process including multifacets modeling, network simulations, deployment, and data exploitation. The proposed framework supports sensor network tools by providing bridges with these tools. Therefore, one description in Modesene can be automatically transformed in each used tool. The framework can perform simulations and code generation. It promotes a data-driven approach; in fact, data obtained by simulations is used to drive design choices. We validate our framework through use case of smart building with two possible solutions. Based on Omnet++ simulator, Modesene can assess node lifetime, costs, and packets loss. Thereafter, the obtained results drive the choice of the suitable solution. Then, the code generator provides source codes for sensor nodes, gateway nodes, and for data exploitation. Compared to existing frameworks, Modesene deals with all design steps. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) introduces various new challenges for business process technologies and workflow management systems (WfMS’s) to be used for managing IoT processes. Especially the interactions with the physical world lead to the emergence of new error sources and unanticipated situations that require a self-adaptive WfMS able to react dynamically to unforeseen situations. Despite a large number of existing WfMS’s, only few systems feature self-x capabilities to be used in the dynamic context of IoT. We present a retrofitting process and generic software component based on the MAPE-K feedback loop to add autonomous capabilities to existing WfMS’s. Using a smart home example process, we show how to retrofit different WfMS’s in an invasive and non-invasive way. Experiments and a brief discussion confirm the feasibility of our retrofitting processes and software component to add self-x capabilities to service-oriented WfMS’s in an IoT context. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The growing Internet of Things (IoT), the increasing use of sensor technology and the digitisation of traditionally isolated analogue devices are transforming manufacturing and private dwellings in the UK. This ongoing revolution is often referred to as Industry 4.0, where real-time data informs the product value chain and digital applications are used for automating service allocation. Within this emerging environment, good practice is essential for productivity. Yet, the access to good practice guides and information is a challenge. Consequently, in this paper, the Productivity Accelerator (ProAccel) platform design is proposed. The system is a modular cloud-based multimedia platform that has the goal of helping UK businesses improve their productivity. ProAccel employs advanced machine learning and gamification techniques to revolutionise the way productivity information is shared. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Context: Application of component based software engineering methods to heterogeneous computing (HC) enables different software configurations to realize the same function with different non–functional properties (NFP). Finding the best software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs is a non–trivial task. Objective: We propose a Software Component Allocation Framework (SCAF) with the goal to acquire a (sub–) optimal software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs, thus providing performance prediction of a software configuration in its early design phase. We focus on the software configuration optimization for the average energy consumption and average execution time. Method: We validated SCAF through its instantiation on a real–world demonstrator and a simulation. Firstly, we verified the correctness of our model through comparing the performance prediction of six software configurations to the actual performance, obtained through extensive measurements with a confidence interval of 95%. Secondly, to demonstrate how SCAF scales up, we performed software configuration optimization on 55 generated use–cases (with solution spaces ranging from 1030 to 3070) and benchmark the results against best performing random configurations. Results: The performance of a configuration as predicted by our framework matched the configuration implemented and measured on a real–world platform. Furthermore, by applying the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to the weight function given in SCAF, we obtain sub–optimal software configurations differing in performance at most 7% and 13% from the optimal configuration (respectfully). Conclusion: SCAF is capable of correctly describing a HC platform and reliably predict the performance of software configuration in the early design phase. Automated in the form of an Eclipse plugin, SCAF allows software architects to model architectural constraints and preferences, acting as a multi–criterion software architecture decision support system. In addition to said, we also point out several interesting research directions, to further investigate and improve our approach. © 2018},

abstract={Data-driven applications are essential to handle the ever-increasing volume, velocity, and veracity of data generated by sources such as the Web and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Simultaneously, an event-driven computational paradigm is emerging as the core of modern systems designed for database queries, data analytics, and on-demand applications. Modern big data processing runtimes and asynchronous many task (AMT) systems from high performance computing (HPC) community have adopted dataflow event-driven model. The services are increasingly moving to an event-driven model in the form of Function as a Service (FaaS) to compose services. An event-driven runtime designed for data processing consists of well-understood components such as communication, scheduling, and fault tolerance. Different design choices adopted by these components determine the type of applications a system can support efficiently. We find that modern systems are limited to specific sets of applications because they have been designed with fixed choices that cannot be changed easily. In this paper, we present a loosely coupled component-based design of a big data toolkit where each component can have different implementations to support various applications. Such a polymorphic design would allow services and data analytics to be integrated seamlessly and expand from edge to cloud to HPC environments. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Oxford English Dictionary defines Prognostics as “an advance indication of a future event, an omen”. Generally, it is confined to fortune or future foretellers, more have subjective or intuition driven. Data Science, on the other hand, embryonically enables to model and predict the health condition of a system and/or its components, based upon current and historical system generated data or status. The chief goal of prognostics is precise estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment or device. Through our research and through industrial field deployment of our Dairy IoT Sensors, we emphatically conclude that Prognostics is a vital marker in the lifecycle of a device that can be deduced as inflection point to trigger auto-corrective, albeit edge analytics driven, in Dairy IoT Sensors so that the desired ship setting functions can be achieved with precision. Having auto-corrective capability, importantly, plays pivotal role in achieving satisfaction of Dairy farmers and reducing the cost of maintaining the Dairy sensors to the manufacturers as these sensors are deployed in geographically different regions with intermittent or network connectivity. Through this paper, we propose an inventive, albeit, small footprint, ML (Machine Learning) dairy edge that incorporates supervised and unsupervised models to detect prognostics conditions so as to infuse auto-corrective behavior to improve the precision of dairy edge. The paper presents industrial dairy sensor design and deployment as well as its data collection and certain field experimental results. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The smart city projects have been more and more popular and widespread all over the world. The continuous increasing of city’s population and the complexity of city management drive local governments towards the strong use of technologies to support a higher quality of urban spaces and a better offering of public services.� The concept of smart cities different from one person to other around the globe. For several experience in the ground show that many cities define themselves as smart but the meaning attributed to this word is different each time.� This paper aims to clarify the meaning of many scientific definitions such as “smart cities”, “internet of things (IOT)”, “big data” and “persuasive technologies” It also identifies the main dimensions and elements characterizing a smart city and introduce a new architecture where part of the smart city where a middleware based on persuasive technologies has been added in order to change actions of citizens toward their cities using the big amount of data generated by their daily activities. This work is a first step for a future study that aim to predict factors and building predictive models for persuasive technologies that change the attitude of citizens in the field of transportation within a smart cities. © International Research Publication House.},

abstract={ICT advances in emerging domains such as Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), big data analytics, cyber-physical systems and cloud computing have revolutionized and boosted the creation of cyberworlds as information spaces that allow us to augment the way we interact with each other and with the physical world. Naturally, other than businesses cyberworlds can benefit modern hyper connected societies at their entirety (transport, mobility, health, smart living, etc.) and further to that the physical world around us can also be part of such process. In the present paper the focus is given on citizenpowered cyberworlds for Environmental Monitoring which are created from crowdsourced observations engaging, through gamification, citizens and communities. The means of engagement include serious gaming, collection of geo-tagged IoT, such as images, video and sensor measurements as well as management and storage of diverse IoT as OGC compliant observations all conveyed into a dedicated information space. ©2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The emerging era of cloud services has already started and the concepts of Internet of Things (IoT) are ready to be introduced in the modern everyday life through the deployment of a large scope of novel applications. In this paper we present the concepts and ideas of the INLIFE project. The software produced by using the INLIFE platform can be seen as a hybrid of a typical e-health application and a typical recreational electronic game and this is one important differentiation of the INLIFE games and apps. The users play an attractive game like e.g. a strategy campaign or an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) but the only way to collect the points or the resources they need in order to play, is to do something in their real life, namely "inlife". These valuable actions, that credit points to the players, are detected in an automatic way by using IoT sensors and actuators or by retrieving information from other monitoring systems like ADL (Activities of Daily Living) data. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, Industrial Automated Control Systems (IACS) are experiencing a new revolution. Information Technology (IT) is ubiquitous down to the lowest level of the workshop. Their cyber-physical nature reveals previously isolated threats and vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are used and new ones are discovered every day, they already target 50% of companies of which 77% are Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Previous works underlined the interest of an intelligent gateway to detect bad behavior, consequences of attacks that could threaten the integrity of a system. The detection is based on rules, Safety of Operation (SoO), firstly established on all the variables of production equipment and then checks on these sets of variable captured on the field network. To facilitate the implementation of such a gateway, the paper proposes a method to help the designer in his configuration. This method is part of a previous design flow with a component-based-approach. In this article we describe the design flow globally, our extension, a reference model for the gateway and steps to perform the generation, as well as integration of the configuration file with the SOO rules, which are validated by a demonstrator. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Ahstract- The industrial cyber-physical production system contains a variety of heterogeneous devices and models, which increase the complexity of system design, particularly in software programming. Although the proposed model-driven engineering (MDE) is applied to industrial automation for this issue, the inherent complex dependencies and constraints between models and the availability of suitable tools for code generation limit the application of the model-driven approach in practice, especially as the system becomes more enormous. The component-based design (CBD) approach, which is a bottom-up approach, in contrast to the MDE that is top-down, is proposed to manage the complexity of software aspect based on the idea that building a system from existing components instead of the scratch. However, CBD can't provide the whole system model, so other ways should be adopted to design the system structure in advance. This paper presents an integrated design approach based on the combination of CBD and MDE to realize auto-design for cyber-physical production systems. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the main tasks in development of intelligent mobile robots is motion control. Some of them are based on the existing and mounted on the mobile robot different sensors, suitable to self-mobile robots control during their motion within outdoor or indoor environments. There are others applications and tasks, where the mobile robot interacts with person or people. For these situations is needed to arrange the so called "human-mobile robot interface", from which is possible to establish mobile robot motion control via human voice or gesture commands. Therefore, the goal in this article is to develop the speech recognition algorithm and model, based on myRIO embedded device and LabView graphical programming language, for audio control of mobile robot motion with voice commands. © 2018 European Union.},

abstract={Gamification applied to service marketing is a growing area of research with an increasing focus on physical location and service. However, there are often accuracy issues with GPS implementations of location-based gamification. In this problem domain, micro-location has emerged. This paper proposes an analysis method to the theme and categorises micro-located gamification applications in an effort to understand the capabilities, advantages and shortcomings of the technology. Data were gathered from 30 micro-located gamification applications between the years of 2013 and 2018. The data were analysed through relational content analysis allowing categorisation and theme identification. Various scenarios are presented where micro-location plays a significant HCI role. Examples of existing services that implement gamification are also presented. Finally, factors that impact the micro-location method are explored. These findings contribute to HCI by providing guidance for present and perspective micro-location gamification implementations. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={With the unprecedented rise in the number of IoT devices, the amount of data generated from sensors is huge and often demands an in-depth analysis to acquire suitable insights. Mashup tools, used primarily for intuitive graphical programming of IoT applications, can help both for efficiently prototyping and also data analytics pipelines. In this study, we focus on the tight integration of data analytics capabilities of Spark in IoT mashup tools. The main challenge in this direction is the presence of a wide range of data interfaces and APIs in the Spark ecosystem. In this study, we contribute to current applications by (i) providing a thorough analysis of the Spark ecosystem and selecting suitable data interfaces for use in a graphical flow-based programming paradigm, (ii) devising a novel, generic approach for programming Spark from graphical flows that comprises early-stage validation and code generation of Java Spark programs. The approach is implemented in aFlux, our JVM-based mashup tool and is evaluated in three use cases showcasing the machine learning and stream analytics capabilities of Spark. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a sweeping revolution in the healthcare industry, with IoT quickly establishing itself as a critical part of modern healthcare. The rapid proliferation of such IoMT devices can bring limitations to the current Cloud-IoT centric infrastructures which are not designed to handle huge volumes and velocity of data generated. To address this problem, it is necessary to revisit the network architecture, pushing some data, processing and services directly on the edge nodes of the network where the data originates, away from the centralized Cloud. In this context, Osmotic Computing (OC) aims to provide a new paradigm for the integration between a centralized Cloud layer and Edge/IoT layers. The deployment and migration strategies through the Cloud and Edge layers depend on the infrastructures and applications requirements. This scientific work promotes the basic principles behind the OC paradigm and proposes a closed-loop OC flow model applied to a gamified cognitive rehabilitation use case. Moreover, the use case introduces the development of a customized virtual reality system based on a serious game which allows the patient to carry out physical and cognitive rehabilitation therapies using a natural user interface based on Microsoft Kinect. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, due to the expected exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT), there is huge demand for adapting IoT in many key situations like day to day life, Industries, Healthcare systems, education systems, smart cites, smart grid, etc. It is also clearly evident that, IoT technology generates huge demand for job opportunities and revenues particularly in the Information technology sector. Thus, there is definite raising demand for IoT professionals. This aspect is highly motivating to teach IoT course as one the major courses for undergraduate engineering students at Universities. IoT is an amalgamation of hardware and software, the students should be exposed to learn and harness their skills in both concepts and technology thoroughly. In this paper, we proposed once such state-of-art laboratory based IoT course named IoT workshop and is offered for the undergraduate engineering students. In this paper, we discuss our experience to highlight need for IoT course, using Node-RED visual programming language, course content, learning objectives, assessment of course, and project ideas. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we outline a methodology allowing to support the formal verification of functional properties for generated code. When relying on a code generator, a model is directly mapped into the target embedded code, in C for instance. At model level, a specification can be associated to the model and used to assess the validity of the model with respect to its requirements. At code level, other means such as deductive methods can be used to ensure similar goals. While the analysis of user-specified properties at model-level is developed and tractable, the automatic verification of these specification at code level remains an open issue. We present here a framework which builds a semantics layer connecting model specification to code specification, as well as associated proof evidences. This approach has been designed and developed in the context of dataflow languages such as Simulink, SCADE or Lustre, typically used in the design of cyber-physical system controllers, but it could also be revisited in other contexts. The model is analyzed by SMT-based model checking and convex optimization-based static analysis. At code level, deductive techniques, such as implemented in Frama-C, are used to prove the functional correctness. Our approach combines static analysis with refinement to drive the proof at code level, relying on analysis results obtained at model level. The refinement relates the initial model semantics with the one of the code. This papers only outlines the methodology combining analyses. It has been applied manually on some examples. A fully implementation remains a future work. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes the development and implementation of an electronic platform for energy management in public buildings. The developed platform prototype is based on the installation of a network of wireless sensors using the emerging Long Range (LoRa) low power long-range wireless network technology. This network is used to collect sensor data, which is stored online and manipulated to extract knowledge and generate actions toward energy saving solutions. In this process, gamification approaches were used to motivate changes in the users’ behavior towards more sustainable actions in public buildings. These actions and the associated processes can be implemented as public services, and they can be replicated to different public buildings, contributing to a more energy-sustainable world. The developed platform allows the monitoring and management of the heating/cooling, electric power consumption, and lighting levels. In order to validate the proposed electronic platform, sensor information was collected in the context of a university campus, which was used as an application scenario in public buildings. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Cross-layer communication protocols can significantly improve several aspects of wireless networks, particularly energy consumption and bandwidth. However, they break with the traditional layered architecture that has been so successful for over 30 years. A fully fledged cross-layer stack requires a sophisticated software design to be maintainable and reusable. The Trustful Space-Time Protocol (TSTP) is a cross-layer protocol designed to deliver authenticated, encrypted, timed, and georeferenced messages containing data compliant with the International System of Units (SI) in a resource-efficient way. By integrating shared data from multiple networking services into a single communication infrastructure, TSTP is able to eliminate replication of information across services, achieving small overhead regarding control messages. The complexity of TSTP's features, its broad range – from the application to the Medium Access Control, – and its experimental nature bring diverse requirements beyond those usually considered in most software designs. In this work, we show how we avoided a monolithic implementation of the cross-layer approach with a component-based design, exploring template metaprogramming techniques to adapt and combine basic building blocks. An event-driven architecture that makes use of zero-copy buffers and metadata is used to handle crosscutting concerns. We validate the proposed design with an implementation for IEEE 802.15.4 networks and a set of OMNet++ simulations for relevant scenarios, showing that we achieve a light TSTP implementation that is successfully able to save energy and bandwidth while keeping a delivery ratio close to 100%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We propose a resonant tunneling diode (RTD)-based relaxation oscillator and an oscillator-based terahertz (THz) wireless link that compensate for shortfalls in RF-oscillator emission power by adding several relaxation carrier wave harmonic modes. We believe that the proposed link can perform as well as or superior to large component-based wireless links that suppress power dissipation using collimating lenses and/or discrete antennas to add the power output of a relaxation oscillator. This hypothesis is investigated analytically using a physics-based equivalent circuit model of the proposed oscillator and a link budget analysis of the relaxation carrier wave. The model, which incorporates effects such as the non-linearity of the tunneling diode and the electromagnetic properties of the integrated bow-tie antenna on the oscillator, is used to quantitatively investigate the link characteristics in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and other parameters and to demonstrate that, by applying an appropriate device size and number of harmonic modes in the occupied bandwidth, link performance comparable to that of previously reported wireless links can be achieved. Based on these results, we discuss the potential for practical implementation of the proposed link configuration in mobile link applications for use in environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems consist of many hardware and software components. Over the life-cycle of these systems, components are replaced or updated. To avoid integration problems, good interface descriptions are crucial for component-based development of these systems. For new components, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) called Component Modeling Analysis (ComMA) can be used to formally define the interface of such a component in terms of its signature, state and timing behavior. Having interfaces described in a model-based approach enables the generation of artifacts, for instance, to generate a monitor that can check interface conformance of components based on a trace of observed interface interactions during execution. The benefit of having formal interface descriptions also holds for legacy system components. Interfaces of legacy components can be reverse engineered manually. In order to reduce the manual effort, we present an automated learner. The learner can reverse engineer state and timing behavior of a legacy interface by examining event traces of the component in operation. The learner will then generate a ComMA model. © 2018 Polish Information Processing Society.},

abstract={Meanwhile, there are several algorithms available to deal with the issue of finding the proper components for Component-based Systems. They all follow a different strategy to determinate an optimal solution, which results in differences in computation speed as well as in memory consumption. These aspects especially matter if the set of the required functions gets very big, so the computational effort raises quickly into unexpected heights. This paper discusses the complexity of the Design Process for Component-based Systems like Cyber-Physical-Systems at the example of Building Automation Systems. Additionally, two selected existing algorithms solving this problem and described in several publications, a Cover and an Evolutionary Approach, will be compared to point out their strengths and weaknesses. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={During the last 10 years, gamification has received increasing attention targeting a variety of people including children, students, youngsters and employers. In addition, great progress has been also observed in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) triggering various researchers' interest. In this paper, we present the core integration architecture and a serious game use case that are both implemented by the InLife project to drive new learning scenarios. InLife is European funded project that focuses on an innovative gamification framework targeting both typical as well as special education and social inclusion activities based on Serious Games. The core concept leverages on the potential of the IoT paradigm to link closely actions, decisions and events happening in real-life with in-game educational progress and modern gaming technologies. This bridge strengthens the infusion of gamification into non-leisure contexts, boosting at the same time the creation of new educational methodologies as well as new business opportunities. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Raising awareness among young people and changing their behavior and habits concerning energy usage and the environment is key to achieving a sustainable planet. The goal to address the global climate problem requires informing the population on their roles in mitigation actions and adaptation of sustainable behaviors. Addressing climate change and achieve ambitious energy and climate targets requires a change in citizen behavior and consumption practices. IoT sensing and related scenario and practices, which address school children via discovery, gamification, and educational activities, are examined in this paper. Use of seawater sensors in STEM education, that has not previously been addressed, is included in these educational scenaria. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Accurate and robust localization is crucial for wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks. Among the localization techniques, component-based methods advance themselves for conquering network sparseness and anchor sparseness. But component-based methods are sensitive to ranging noises, which may cause a huge accumulated error either in component realization or merging process. This paper presents three results for robust component-based localization under ranging noises. (1) For a rigid graph component, a novel method is proposed to evaluate the graph's possible number of flip ambiguities under noises. In particular, graph's \emph{MInimal sepaRators that are neaRly cOllineaR (MIRROR) } is presented as the cause of flip ambiguity, and the number of MIRRORs indicates the possible number of flip ambiguities under noise. (2) Then the sensitivity of a graph's local deforming regarding ranging noises is investigated by perturbation analysis. A novel Ranging Sensitivity Matrix (RSM) is proposed to estimate the node location perturbations due to ranging noises. (3) By evaluating component robustness via the flipping and the local deforming risks, a Robust Component Generation and Realization (RCGR) algorithm is developed, which generates components based on the robustness metrics. RCGR was evaluated by simulations, which showed much better noise resistance and locating accuracy improvements than state-of-the-art of component-based localization algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports on the approach for the design and development of the H2020 ChArGED project framework. ChArGED addresses energy wastage and proposes a framework that aims to facilitate achieving greater energy efficiency in public buildings. The framework leverages IoT-enabled low-cost devices, to improve energy disaggregation mechanisms that provide energy use and -consequently- wastage information at the device, area and end-user level. The identified wastages are concurrently targeted by a gamified application that feeds personalized real-time recommendations to each individual enduser. The ChArGED solution is being developed iteratively, with the end-users' engagement during the analysis, design and development phases in public buildings located in 3 different countries: Luxembourg (Musée National d'Histoire et d'Art), Spain (EcoUrbanBuilding, Institut Català d'Energia headquarters, Barcelona) and Greece (General Secretariat of the Municipality of Athens). © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The world is moving into a new era, Internet of Things (IoT) that means everything surrounding us will have their corresponding virtual image in the cloud and they will communicate with each other. In this research, a component based unified architecture for utility service in the cloud has been proposed for deploying service and use of the application in an optimum way to make the maximum availability of service within the limited duration of time and minimum configuration overhead. Our proposed architecture is divided into several layers and each layer is designed based on several components. Experimentally we observe through IBM Bluemix [28] proposed utility service system along with its working procedure and corresponding performance evaluation, which is promising. Therefore, we found proposed architecture is also capable to protect utility service and corresponding resources from external threats. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are important in today’s technology for helping to monitor our environment. WSNs are widely used in military, medical and industrial environments. It is capable of monitoring, collecting and transmitting data to a primary server wirelessly. Wireless sensor nodes are powered by a limited energy supply such as a small battery or an energy harvester that generally produces a small amount of energy. To extend the lifetime of the device, energy consumption must be reduced. Data transmission is known to consume the largest percentage of energy in a sensor node. One method for reducing energy is by compressing the data prior to transmitting it. This study analyses the performance of the Huffman architecture in terms of compressing data that are commonly used in wireless sensor nodes. The primary module in the architecture comprises a data retriever, frequency calculator, probability calculator, Huffman tree generator and Huffman code generator. From the experimental results, the Huffman circuit architecture simulation consumed 51394 clock cycles to completely compress 366 data samples, using 3.729mW of power consumption. Based on a 20MHz clock frequency, this is equivalent to 9.5824µJ of energy consumption. Based on our analyses, the Huffman tree generator consumed the most power at 1.184mW, equivalent to 31.75% of overall power consumption. © 2018, Universiti Malaysia Perlis. All rights reserved.},

Earth Hour fue una competición para ver qué vecindario podía presumir de la mayoría de los residentes con sus luces apagadas durante una hora [7], y Chicago Neighborhood Energy Challenge que fue un programa piloto de seis meses lanzado en noviembre de 2013 en el que residentes de siete edificios multifamiliares en dos barrios compitieron para lograr las mayores reducciones en su uso de electricidad, gas y agua. El énfasis del desafío estaba en modificaciones de comportamiento dentro de ambientes caseros existente [8]. El concurso "Biggest Energy Saver" fue una competencia piloto a pequeña escala que tuvo lugar entre septiembre y noviembre de 2011 en San Diego. Cerca de 200 hogares compitieron entre sí para lograr la mayor reducción en el uso de energía. El concurso fue desarrollado por Grid 21, una organización sin fines de lucro que trabaja con clientes de electricidad para hacer un mejor uso de los datos de medidores inteligentes [9]. En el caso de Power Agent dos equipos, cada uno formado por una familia con adolescentes, compitieron durante 10 días para lograr la mayor reducción relativa en el consumo de electricidad. Cada equipo vivía en una pequeña ciudad sueca distinta. Un sistema automático de lectura de medidores recopiló datos en tiempo real sobre el uso de la electricidad en el hogar y cada día se les anunciaba a los jugadores una misión de varias horas que les permitía cooperar con el ahorro de electricidad [10].},

abstract={Energy markets are based on energy transactions with a central control entity, where the players are companies. In this research work, we propose an IoT (Internet of Things) system for the accounting of energy flows, as well as a blockchain approach to overcome the need for a central control entity. This allows for the creation of local energy markets to handle distributed energy transactions without needing central control. In parallel, the system aggregates users into communities with target goals and creates new markets for players. These two approaches (blockchain and IoT) are brought together using a gamification approach, allowing for the creation and maintenance of a community for electricity market participation based on pre-defined goals. This community approach increases the number of market players and creates the possibility of traditional end users earning money through small coordinated efforts. We apply this approach to the aggregation of batteries from electrical vehicles so that they become a player in the spinning reserve market. It is also possible to apply this approach to local demand flexibility, associated with the demand response (DR) concept. DR is aggregated to allow greater flexibility in the regulation market based on an OpenADR approach that allows the turning on and off of predefined equipment to handle local microgeneration. © MDPI AG.

abstract={Today's adaptive software systems (i) are often highly configurable product lines, exhibiting hundreds of potentially conflicting configuration options; (ii) are context dependent, forcing the system to reconfigure to ever-changing contextual situations at runtime; (iii) need to fulfill context-dependent performance goals by optimizing measurable nonfunctional properties. Usually, a large number of consistent configurations exists for a given context, and each consistent configuration may perform differently with regard to the current context and performance goal(s). Therefore, it is crucial to consider nonfunctional properties for identifying an appropriate configuration. Existing black-box approaches for estimating the performance of configurations provide no means for determining context-sensitive reconfiguration decisions at runtime that are both consistent and optimal, and hardly allow for combining multiple context-dependent quality goals. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) for obtaining consistent and optimal reconfiguration decisions. We use training data obtained from simulations to learn performance-influence models. A novel integrated runtime representation captures both consistency properties and the learned performance-influence models. Our solution provides the flexibility to define multiple context-dependent performance goals. We have implemented our approach as a standalone component. Based on an Internet-of-Things case study using adaptive wireless sensor networks, we evaluate our approach with regard to effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Home energy savings via eco-feedback is often considered a serious, tedious, or even distracting task due to the need for frequent human intervention. In addition, most existing eco-feedback systems focus on providing energy usage information and ignore the users' contexts. This may render the systems incapable of capturing the users' changes when proenvironmental behaviors have been encouraged. To address this, our study leverages Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies to realize an adaptive, context-aware, and playful cyber-physical system (CPS) for everyday energy savings with the hope of facilitating collaboration between a person and a smart energy-saving (ES) system to the greatest extent possible. To leverage the benefits inherent in a CPS, bidirectionally interactive information visualization integrated with pet-raising gamification was incorporated into the adaptive CPS. This synchronized the information from the user's physical environment with its counterpart in the pet's virtual environment. In order to provide flexible services, all IoT devices were agentized to form reconfigurable agents. In our experimental evaluation, this bidirectional mapping empowered users to flexibly control remote appliances anywhere and anytime in a more natural way, which enabled users to embed interactions with the ES CPS into their daily routine. Furthermore, improvements to system adaptability (33% in precision; 21% in recall) along with the reconfigurable ES services (additionally saving energy about 16.21%) show the potential of the CPS to enhance the users' experience and prolong the users' engagement in everyday energy savings. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Integration of different cyber-physical systems involves a development process that takes into account some solutions for intercommunicating and interoperating heterogeneous devices. Each device can be managed as a thing within the Internet-of-Things concept by using web technologies. In addition, a “thing” can be managed as an encapsulated component by applying component-based software engineering principles. Based on this context, we propose a solution for integrating heterogeneous systems using a specific component-based technology. Specifically, we focus on enabling the connection of different types of subsystems present in smart home solutions. This technology enables interoperability by applying a homogeneous component representation that provides communication features through web sockets, and by implementing gateways in proprietary network connections. Furthermore, our solution eases the extension of these systems by means of abstract representations of the architectures and devices that form part of them. The approach is validated through an example scenario with different subsystems of a smart home solution. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Due to the extensive code reuse, homologous binaries are widely found in IoT firmwares. Once a vulnerability is found in one firmware, other firmwares sharing the similar piece of codes are at high risk. Thus, homologous binary search is of great significance to IoT firmware security analysis. However, there are still no scalable and efficient homologous binary search methods for IoT firmwares. The time complexity of the traditional method is O(N), so it is not scalable for large-scale IoT firmwares. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a scalable and efficient homologous binary search scheme for IoT firmwares with time complexity O(lgN). The main idea of our methodology is encoding binary file's readable strings by deep learning network and then generating a local sensitive Hash of the encoding vector for the fast retrieval. We compiled 893 open source components based on 16 different compile-time parameters, resulting in 71 129 pairs of labeled binary files for training and testing the network model. The results show that our method has better ROC characteristics than the traditional method. In addition, the study case shows that our method can complete one homologous binary file retrieval task for 22 594 firmware in less than 1 second. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={Paroxysmal diseases of inpatients are globally recognized as one of the top challenges in medicine. Poor clinical outcomes are primarily caused by delayed recognition, especially due to diverse clinical diagnostic criteria with complex manifestations, irregular episodes, and already overloaded clinical activities. With the proliferation of measuring devices and increased computational capabilities, cyber-physical characterization plays an increasingly important role in many domains to provide enabling technologies. This paper presents a cyber-physical system (CPS) framework to assist physicians in making earlier diagnoses of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity based on existing medical knowledge. We propose a configurable diagnostic knowledge model to characterize clinical criteria to reduce domain knowledge deficiency between physicians and computer scientists. We present a component-based medical CPS framework to employ the knowledge models and integrate medical devices. Our approach aims to relieve medical staff from the heavy burden of clinical activities and to provide timely decision support. We evaluate our approach on 128 real-world clinical cases. Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, the results demonstrate that we enable early detection in 11.02% more patients and detect the condition 16.57 hours earlier on average. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we first propose a visual block language Smart Block for IoT, especially for SmartThings. We also developed a visual programming environment for Smart Block so that users can write their own SmartApps in this language easily, even though they are not expert programmers. We designed the language based on IoTa calculus, a core calculus for Internet of Things Automation that generalizes Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules for home automation. We implemented a visual programming environment for Smart Block with Blockly, a client-side JavaScript library for creating visual block languages. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The design of software for networked systems with nodes running an Internet of things operating system faces important challenges due to the heterogeneity of interacting things and the constraints stemming from the often limited amount of available resources. In this context, it is hard to build confidence that a design solution fulfills the application's requirements. This paper introduces a design flow for web service applications of the representational state transfer style that is based on a formal modeling language, the behaviour, interaction, priority (BIP) component framework. The proposed flow applies the principles of separation of concerns in a component-based design process that supports the modular design and reuse of model artifacts. The BIP tools for state-space exploration allow verifying qualitative properties for service responsiveness, ie, the timely handling of events. Moreover, essential quantitative properties are validated through statistical model checking of a stochastic BIP model. All properties are preserved in actual implementation by ensuring that the deployed code is consistent with the validated model. We illustrate the design of a representational state transfer sense-compute-control application for a Wireless Personal Area Network architecture with nodes running the Contiki operating system. The results validate qualitative and quantitative properties for the system and include the study of error behaviours. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Smart buildings will play a fundamental role in ensuring comfort while reducing the energy required. However, due to the lack of knowledge about the operation of the smart controllers, the occupants can unintentionally increase the energy spent. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the informed and motivated user will actually cooperate with the system. Some of the issues associated with researching control systems in the context of building automation are difficult to address, because of the chronic lack of effective laboratory settings for experimentation. In this paper, we describe a system representative of the usual complexity found in cyber-physical systems, whose purpose is to address the needs for experimenting with building automation, with a focus on control systems and gamification. Designed with pragmatic concerns, this system presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities to research a new generation of software control systems, and supporting interfaces, that leverage the occupants' behaviour. © 2018 ACM.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) can be defined as an integration of various computation, networking and physical processes. CPSs that operate critical functions have many requirements, such as robustness, safety and security, Quality of Service (QoS) and trust. As CPSs typically combine a wide variety of hardware, software, digital and analog technologies, engineering these requirements through analysis, verification and controls is incredibly challenging. With respect to security, the science of protecting CPSs from blended attacks (combining attacks on digital and physical aspects) is yet to be developed. On this front, one much-needed component is a suitable environment in which to pursue lines of experimentation and exploration. In this paper, we introduce a special testbed under development that will allow security researchers to experiment with blended attack/defend scenarios in CPSs. The testbed also constitutes a competitive learning environment in which students can explore and master fundamental concepts, techniques and practices for defending CPSs. Examples and approaches for applying the testbed in CPS security education and research are presented. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Deploying remote laboratories at a very large scale is one of the upcoming challenges in remote experimentation. It is referred to as Massive Open Online Labs (MOOLs). Being able to sustain a massive number of users accessing a specific resource concurrently is a complex task. The challenge is to maximize the use of the shared resource (the online lab) while minimizing or even canceling the waiting time to access the online lab such that the user feels it is dedicated to him/her. Tackling this problem requires revisiting both the pedagogical and the technical methodologies of online lab implementation, sharing, and deployment. In this chapter, we use indifferently online labs or remote labs to refer to physical labs accessible at distance through the Internet. A remote lab can also be considered as a cyber-physical system (CPS) as a combination of sensors, actuators, and embedded intelligence to fulfill given operational objectives. Remote experimentation is becoming a mature technology, and it is usual to see institutions or platforms offering a significant number of remote labs. The model often chosen to enable online access to these labs is Laboratory as a Service (LaaS), where the lab is seen as a set of resources that the user can select on demand. The Smart Device model follows to the LaaS scheme and tries to describe the physical lab equipment and its digital components and interfaces as a unique entity. The Smart Device is seen through a set of services that the user can connect to. There is an ongoing effort to standardize the relationship between all the components (software, hardware, and learning environments). The aim of this standard is to ease the design, the implementation, and the usage of pedagogically oriented online laboratories as smart learning objects and their integration in learning environments and learning object repositories. The initial Smart Device model has been enriched to provide remote application developers a set of noteworthy configurations since not all combinations of sensors, actuators, and services are meaningful. The Smart Device and other LaaS models are the cornerstone for deploying Massive Open Online Labs (MOOLs), but alone, they just provide a one-to-one (1:1) access: One user accesses one real equipment at a time. Various solutions such as efficient time-sharing and resource duplication are proposed to increase the numbers of concurrent users, and a ratio of 5-10:1 is possible. The next step is to be able to handle the massive access, in the range of 50-100:1. Accommodating such a large number of concurrent users to access a real critical resource is a challenge that can be addressed by first giving priority to some users, for example, using gamification mechanisms. The analysis of the online usage pattern also permits a real-time adaptation of the various session parameters and session ordering. Lastly providing usage awareness is a key to help users select the best experimentation time. This paper first provides some historical perspective and rationale to introduce the Smart Device model and its recent modifications toward completeness. Then, it proposes the required modifications in both the pedagogical and technical aspects to "traditional" remote lab in order to support the massive aspect of MOOCs. The MOOC and MOOL infrastructures are then described, especially how a Smart Device client application is integrated in a MOOC as an LTI module and how this application is able to interact with other applications or tools such as simulations. This paper focuses on technical aspects, currently deployed, to implement such a remote lab within a MOOC infrastructure. It first covers the Smart Device specifications and its latest extensions. Then, the technical aspects such as the Smart Device implementation (server side) and the HTML5 client application are described. The components used for the deployment such as the LTI interface, the user storage, and other interactive tools are presented. The load balancer and the methods used to control the access are then depicted. This paper provides a learning scenario for a MOOC session using the above elements, and an example is given with the control system lab deployed in edX, where more than 200 students access concurrently a farm of 30 electrical drives. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={This paper is concerned by the fact that the health sector represents a major development challenge for emerging countries. However, it faces many challenges that affect the quality of care provided and makes it almost impossible to guarantee an adequate level of accessibility for all social classes of the population. These reasons motivated us to study a medical control system based on the Internet of Things that could significantly improve the conditions of medical care and ensure effective and effective medical follow-up by automating the process of taking during the consultations and by preserving the information thus obtained for restitution in case of emergency or medical follow-up of the patients. At the end of our study, we were able to define the challenges posed by technological tools in improving the conditions of health structures and to simulate the functioning of the system we designed. © 2018 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI).},

abstract={Programmable microfluidic laboratories-on-a-chip (LoCs) offer automation and miniaturization to the life sciences. This paper updates the BioCoder language and introduces a fully static (offline) compiler which can target Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs), one type of programmable LoC. The language and runtime leverage sensor integration to execute bio-assays which feature online decision-making based on sensory data. The compiler employs a hybrid intermediate representation (IR) that interleaves fluidic operations with computation on sensor data. The IR extends traditional notions of liveness and interference to fluidic variables and operations to target the DMFB, which has abundant spatial parallelism. The code generator converts the IR into: (1) electrode activation sequences for each basic block in the control flow graph; (2) a set of computations performed on sensor data, which dynamically resolve control flow operations; and (3) electrode activation sequences for control flow transfers. The compiler is validated using a simulator which produces animated videos of bioassay execution. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Robot control systems are complex cyber-physical systems which are difficult to develop. In this paper, we present a formal model-based automatic code synthesis method which can generate executable C++ code running on the world-wide used Robot Operating System (ROS). The internal interaction behaviors of robot systems are modeled as a network of timed automata. The safety requirements and specifications related to the model are formalized as CTL formulas and verified by Uppaal. We design a code synthesis method to generate the executable C++ code from the verified model. Compared to existing code generators based on timed automata, our method supports more complex structures and advanced features such as timer and committed location, and provides the important abstraction and mapping of ROS instructions, which realize the seamless connection between the generated code and ROS. A case study of grasping a cup by a robot with seven degrees of freedom manipulator is conducted and the generated codes are successfully applied to a ROS development environment. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Conserving energy amenable to the activities of occupants in public buildings is a particularly challenging objective that includes associating energy consumption to particular individuals and providing them with incentives to alter their behavior. This paper describes a gamification framework that aims to facilitate achieving greater energy conservation in public buildings. The framework leverages IoT-enabled low-cost devices, to improve energy disaggregation mechanisms that provide energy use and—consequently—wastage information at the device, area and end-user level. The identified wastages are concurrently targeted by a gamified application that motivates respective behavioral changes combining team competition, virtual rewards and life simulation. Our solution is being developed iteratively with the end-users’ engagement during the analysis, design, development and validation phases in public buildings located in three different countries: Luxembourg (Musée National d’Histoire et d’Art), Spain (EcoUrbanBuilding, Institut Català d’Energia headquarters, Barcelona) and Greece (General Secretariat of the Municipality of Athens). © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={At present, users are able to obtain a variety of image contents easily via visual sensor networks. Under this circumstance, the detection of adult or harmful images has become a highly important issue. This paper proposes an algorithm for analyzing images in the visual sensor network and robustly detecting the human nipple and navel regions, which can be used for harmful image detection. From a color image, the proposed algorithm first detects skin color areas and locates human facial regions, including the eyes and lips. The algorithm then creates a color-based nipple map for detecting candidate regions of nipples from the extracted skin regions. If a detected candidate nipple region is located within the detected facial region, the candidate nipple region is removed because it has been incorrectly detected. Subsequently, by utilizing geometrical features and the mean color filter of the nipples, the method filters the candidate regions of nipples in two steps and detects the actual nipple regions. Lastly, this method exploits the structural relation between the detected nipple regions and the navel areas to be detected, and uses the edge and saturation images to detect the navel region robustly. Experimental results reveal that the proposed adult image algorithm detects the human nipple and navel regions from various types of images more reliably than existing algorithms. Since the proposed approach uses the human structure information of the nipple and navel regions to filter the candidate navel regions effectively, it removes many incorrectly detected regions, which results in high accuracy. We expect that the proposed nipple and navel region detection algorithm will be successfully employed to detect and block harmful images in various real applications. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Critical infrastructures and industrial control systems are complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To ensure reliable operations of such systems, comprehensive threat modeling during system design and validation is of paramount significance. Previous works in literature mostly focus on safety, risks and hazards in CPS but lack effective threat modeling necessary to eliminate cyber vulnerabilities. Further, impact of cyber attacks on physical processes is not fully understood. This paper presents a comprehensive threat modeling framework for CPS using STRIDE, a systematic approach for ensuring system security at the component level. This paper first devises a feasible and effective methodology for applying STRIDE and then demonstrates it against a real synchrophasor-based synchronous islanding testbed in the laboratory. It investigates (i) what threat types could emerge in each system component based on the security properties lacking, and (ii) how a vulnerability in a system component risks the entire system security. The paper identifies that STRIDE is a light-weight and effective threat modeling methodology for CPS that simplifies the task for security analysts to identify vulnerabilities and plan appropriate component level security measures at the system design stage. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The recent emergence of smart cities is highly supported by the development of IT and IoT technologies. Nevertheless, a smart city needs to be built to meet the needs and requirements of its citizens. In order to build a smart city it is necessary to understand the benefits of such a city. A smart city is, beyond technology, populated by people. A smart city can be raised by its citizens' contribution, and gamification is the means to motivate them. In this paper we included gamification techniques in the stage of capturing the citizens' requirements for building a smart city. The system proposed in the paper is to create an application that allows the building of a virtual smart city customized by each user.

abstract={To reduce energy consumption and improve residents’ quality of life, “smart cities” should use not only modern technologies, but also the social innovations of the “Internet of Things” (IoT) era. This article attempts to solve transport problems in a smart city’s office district by utilizing gamification that incentivizes the carpooling system. The goal of the devised system is to significantly reduce the number of cars, and, consequently, to alleviate traffic jams, as well as to curb pollution and energy consumption. A representative sample of the statistical population of people working in one of the biggest office hubs in Poland (the so-called “Mordor of Warsaw”) was surveyed. The collected data were processed using spatial data mining methods, and the results were a set of parameters for the multi-agent system. This approach made it possible to run a series of simulations on a set of 100,000 agents and to select an effective gamification methodology that supports the carpooling process. The implementation of the proposed solutions (a “serious game” variation of urban games) would help to reduce the number of cars by several dozen percent, significantly reduce energy consumption, eliminate traffic jams, and increase the activity of the smart city residents. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Modeling cyber-physical systems (CPSs) for assessment or design support purposes is a complex activity. Capturing all relevant physical, structural or behavioral aspects of the system at hand is a crucial task, which often implies representation of peculiar features/constraints through non-linear equations. Values that fulfill the constraints, described with a domain specific language, are obtained solving the equations through a properly developed solution tool. Only for a limited set of CPSs it is possible to find a straightforward strategy to design the software that solves the constraints equations. In the general case, instead, the modeler has to develop an ad-hoc artifact for each different system. This is the case of non-holomorphic but real analytic complex equations, adopted to represent system components with wave behaviors. In this paper, we present a new approach to develop a software for solving such complex equations following a generative programming strategy, based on Wirtinger derivatives within the Newton-Raphson method.

abstract={A key challenge of component-based software engineering is to preserve extra-functional properties such as security when composing the software architecture from individual components. Previous work in this area does not consider specific characteristics of cyber-physical systems like asynchronous message passing, real-time behavior, or so-called feedback composition with two-way communication. Thereby, a composition of secure components might lead to insecure architectures with undetected information leaks. In this paper, we address the preservation of information flow security on composition of cyber-physical systems, taking the above characteristics into account. We refine security policies during the architectural decomposition, and outline a compositional verification approach that checks the security of individual components against their refined policies. On composition of secure components, our approach preserves security and thereby enables the design of secure software architectures. We give a proof of concept using a component-based software architecture of a cyber-manufacturing system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={IoT devices are diverse in their characteristics and made by many vendors, hence the inter-operation among them is difficult. Especially, end users can't make their own programs by do-it-yourselves. IFTTT and Zapier platforms are designed to help end users to make them inter-operable easily and prevail in these days. Their approach is categorized into a Trigger-Action-Programming, in which trigger conditions and actions are already made by professional programmers of several IoT vendors and end users composite them into their own applications easily. But, their drawback is that the composition can be made at once in the first level, hence end users can't make more complicated applications. Our approach is based on a dataflow programming paradigm which resembles the TAP in that the internal actions are triggered when all the inputs of a node are prepared. In our approach, a composition of some atomic nodes becomes another atomic node, so the composition would continue iteratively. This feature is so generous that several visual programming languages like LabView are relied on the approach for various fields. We propose the overall architecture of our system and explain them. We also present Internet of Things examples of our approach, which shows that atomic dataflow objects can be associated to produce composite dataflow objects. And they are also composited to make more complex applications iteratively. We compare IFTTT, Zapier, and our approach qualitatively and show that end users can make more diverse and flexible applications in our approach. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Racing sailboats are becoming more and more complex systems, especially with the increasing interest in total 3D attitude control. In such competitive context, realistic simulation appears as a key point for new developments. This paper presents AVS, a framework dedicated to sailboat simulation, integrating both requirements of a generic simulation framework and domain-specific aspects. The AVS framework provides a collection of models and tools to design, generate and evaluate racing sailboat simulations. Tools are also provided to integrate heterogeneous wind sources in simulation. Thanks to component-based approach, different simulation scenarios can be considered by adding or configuring components. Two simulation examples illustrate the AVS framework agility to evaluate sailing boat control law. © 2016},

abstract={As the percentage of the total population living in urban regions is increasing, new challenges for the cities of the future arise. Smart Cities emerged as a solution to these challenges building on the strength of intelligent information, communication technologies and Internet of Things. In this work, we discuss the importance of semantic technologies as well as open IoT APIs for the future Smart Cities applications. Through an illustrative application, we demonstrate that both of the aforementioned technologies ease the computational burden of implementation, foster programming sustainability and create the necessary conditions so as to rapidly harness the available information and extract knowledge out of it. At the same time, the application’s implementation lies in accordance with the latest IoT architectural recommendations such as Visual Programming interfaces for Service Composition, conformance with Big Data technologies and the latest IoT programming paradigms. © 2018, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Model-driven development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) requires modeling techniques based on a well-founded theory that supports addressing development techniques, such as decomposition, refinement and the different notions of time required by its components. Based on an elaborated theory for the modeling of underspecification with respect to nondeterminism, hierarchical composition, refinement that is compatible with composition, and finally proven correct evolution patterns, we discuss how such a theory can be practically applied for the development of CPS. Through an orchestrated efficient simulation, we can identify potential bottlenecks, function failures, hardware risks, etc. early. All models as well as the simulation take advantage of the compositionality and the timing refinement properties of the theory. In summary, we discuss how the elaborated theory shapes the simulation and the results. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Modern cyber-physical systems are complex to model due, among other things, to timing constraints and complex communications between components of such systems. Therefore, testing models of these systems is not straightforward. This paper presents an approach for automatically testing components of UML-RT models with respect to a set of formally defined properties. Compared to existing model-based techniques where abstract test cases are complemented with their concrete counterparts, our approach solely leverages on constructs provided by the modeling language to express all artifacts (component to test, test harness, the property of interest) and existing code generator to generate test cases. This helps to reduce the cost of ensuring the consistency between code- and model-level tests. Moreover, to reduce the number of test cases and the associated cost, our approach integrates our test case generators with slicing techniques to reduce the size of the components. A prototype implementation has been sketched and our approach has been evaluated over two case studies. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper reports on innovative teaching interventions in the frame of Internet of Things (IoT) design ideation classes. A card-based gamification approach has been applied in two different engineering masters courses. The participating students had already a good understanding of IoT technologies and they were asked to produce innovative designs by using them. We examine here the produced design ideas and the students’ perception of the collaborative design process and tools. The paper discusses broader issues relating to applicability of design- and ideation-focused gamification methods in the context of engineering education and the effect they have on collaborative design and innovation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={The level of intelligence in monitoring & controlling systems are increasing dramatically. The critical issue for an autonomous resilient system is detecting the anomalous behavior through standard patterns to react properly and on time. In cyber-physical systems with the interaction of humans and machines, this will be more complicated. Deceptive alarm is a common dilemma in real systems which could reduce awareness and readiness and accordingly resilience of the system. In this paper, Markov modeling technique is used to predict human behaviors patterns to distinguish between human anomalous behavior and system failure. The data is from the real experience of implementing innovative monitoring system in a five-star hotel which was part of the project of gamification for changing guests’ behavior. The idea was to develop Resilience Supported System to decrease the fault error and alarms and to increase the reliability and resilience of the system. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.},

abstract={Future production systems demand for a standardized digital representation of I4.0 components including their capabilities. Many concepts of such a digital representation have been published under the term administration shell. However, these concepts do not explicitly cover the use of administration shells to orchestrate real-time capable I4.0 components. In this paper, we recap an existing I4.0 framework that enables the dynamic orchestration of non-real-time I4.0 components. As main contribution, we integrate real-time capable I4.0 components into this framework. Thereby, the entire communication is standard-compliant to the new real-time technology Time-Sensitive Networking (IEEE 802.1). The advantages of our approach are demonstrated by a dynamic plug-and-produce scenario in which real-time axes are controlled based on G-code. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Students nowadays are hard to be motivated to study lessons with traditional teaching methods. Computers, smartphones, tablets and other smart devices disturb students' attentions. Nevertheless, those smart devices can be used as auxiliary tools of modern teaching methods. In this article, the authors review two popular modern teaching methods: flipped classroom and gamification. Next, they implement flipped classrooms as an element of IoT (Internet of Things) into learning process of computer networks course, by using Cisco networking academy tools, instead of traditional learning. The survey provided to students shows good feedback from students. The authors report the impact of flipped classroom implementation with data obtained from two parallel sections (one flipped classroom and the other traditional classroom). The results show that the flipped classroom approach is better than the traditional classroom approach with a difference of approximately 20% increase in the average of attendance, lab work, quizzes, midterm exams and final exam. © 2018 IGI Global.

abstract={IoT Applications coordinate the interaction of business services and IoT Devices, that automate business processes. The trend in building IoT Applications is to deploy their services on cloud platforms, which allow applications to take advantage of the cloud platform capabilities (e.g., large and dynamic storage and processing capacities). However, in spite of the growing number of IoT Applications, currently, their implementation is realized in an ad-hoc manner, without taking into account the heterogeneity of cloud platforms and IoT Devices. In this context, the interoperability among business services, IoT Devices and cloud resources available is a primary concern. In this article, we propose an Architecture Description Language (ADL) to specify the integration and interaction between IoT Devices and application services deployed in cloud environments, independently of their technologies. In addition, we propose an intelligent automation tool that provides: (i) a graphical editor for the ADL, and (ii) an automated code generator, that uses the architectural descriptions to generate software artifacts that implement the integration and interaction between the application services and IoT Devices. To illustrate the use of this ADL, the implementation of a Geographic Information System that supports the analysis of spatial data collected by air quality sensors, with geo-services deployed in the Google Cloud platform, is presented. © 2018 Computer Society of the Republic of China.

abstract={In embedded network software running on embedded systems within the Internet of Things (IoT), high levels of runtime efficiency and user productivity are required. As an approach to improve the productivity of software development, the mruby on TOPPERS embedded component system (TECS) framework has been proposed; note that mruby on TECS framework employs a scripting language (i.e., a lightweight Ruby implementation) and supports component-based development. In this paper, we propose an extended mruby on TECS framework for its application in developing software for IoT devices, including sensors and actuators. Our proposed framework enables mruby programs to utilize Tomakomai Internetworking (TINET), a TCP/IP protocol stack specifically designed for use in embedded systems. Further, the proposed framework incorporates two component-based functions, i.e., a componentized TINET stack called TINET+TECS and a componentized Two-Level Segregate Fit (TLSF) dynamic memory allocator called TLSF+TECS. Here, TINET+TECS improves configurability and scalability and offers software developers high levels of productivity through variable network buffer sizes and the ability to add or remove various TCP (or UDP) functions. TINET+TECS utilizes a dynamic TECS component connection method to satisfy the original TINET specifications. Further, TLSF+TECS is a thread-safe memory allocator that runs at high speeds and efficiently consumes memory. The experimental results of the comparison between TINET+TECS and the original TINET show that execution time and memory consumption overhead are both reduced; further, we conclude that configurability is improved. Finally, the TLSF+TECS function which obtains and reports statistical information regarding mruby’s virtual machine (VM) memory usage, helps developers debug and verify their embedded IoT systems. © 2018 Information Processing Society of Japan.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to focus on data analytic tools and integrated data analyzing approaches used on smart energy meters (SEMs). Furthermore, while observing the diverse techniques and frameworks of data analysis of SEM, the authors propose a novel framework for SEM by using gamification approach for enhancing the involvement of consumers to conserve energy and improve efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: A few research strategies have been accounted for analyzing the raw data, yet at the same time, a considerable measure of work should be done in making these commercially reasonable. Data analytic tools and integrated data analyzing approaches are used on SEMs. Furthermore, while observing the diverse techniques and frameworks of data analysis of SEM, the authors propose a novel framework for SEM by using gamification approach for enhancing the involvement of consumers to conserve energy and improve efficiency. Advantages of SEM's are additionally discussed for inspiring consumers, utilities and their respective partners. Findings: Consumers, utilities and researchers can also take benefit of the recommended framework by planning their routine activities and enjoying rewards offered by gamification approach. Through gamification, consumers’ commitment enhances, and it changes their less manageable conduct on an intentional premise. The practical implementation of such approaches showed the improved energy efficiency as a consequence. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The pace of proliferation for smart systems in city wide applications is unmatched. The introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), an enabler of smart city phenomenon, has incubated a productive environment for such innovations. Smart things equipped with IoT capabilities, allow for developing smart city applications at such large scale that each application can be represented as a system of systems (SoS). Nevertheless, the complexity of engineering such SoS has been a major challenge in developing and maintaining smart city applications. One of the engineering challenges that industry face today is the verification of a SoS smart city application at runtime. We introduce utilization of a model-based runtime monitoring approach for providing reliable service. We propose to use message sequence charts for representing a smart city application, later allow the practitioners to express expected behavior of an application in terms of complex-event processing patterns. We demonstrate the fidelity of our approach on a sample smart parking system. Our approach is one of its kind in enabling a non-intrusive monitoring of IoT behavior at runtime (online). © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, we present the current position of the research project ML-Quadrat, which aims to extend the methodology, modeling language and tool support of ThingML - an open source modeling tool for IoT/CPS - to address Machine Learning needs for the IoT applications. Currently, ThingML offers a modeling language and tool support for modeling the components of the system, their communication interfaces as well as their behaviors. The latter is done through state machines. However, we argue that in many cases IoT/CPS services involve system components and physical processes, whose behaviors are not well understood in order to be modeled using state machines. Hence, quite often a data-driven approach that enables inference based on the observed data, e.g., using Machine Learning is preferred. To this aim, ML-Quadrat integrates the necessary Machine Learning concepts into ThingML both on the modeling level (syntax and semantics of the modeling language) and on the code generators level. We plan to support two target platforms for code generation regarding Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing, namely Apache Samoa and Apama. © 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

funding_text 1={We believe that the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) methodologies and tools for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) must support the Artificial Intelligence (AI) needs of these applications both on the modeling level and also on the code generation level in an integrated and seamless manner. Hence, we propose an alternative view for modeling the behavior of components, i.e., things in ThingML. This new view enables users of the tool to delegate the definition of the behavior of the thing (i.e, system competent or IoT device) to the AI algorithms (specifically ML algorithms), which are able to conduct inference based on the observed data. In other words, for complex behaviors that are not easily understandable and specifiable via state machines, the ML algorithms can learn the respective behaviors on their own in an effective and efficient manner. In addition, we provide an extension to the existing view for specifying behaviors using state machines so that advanced data analytics algorithms and methods can be employed for event detection and triggering state transitions. This latter contribution is inline with the contributions of the research project HEADS funded by the European Commission (FP7), where Complex Event Processing (CEP) capabilities have been introduced to the ThingML tool (also known as the HEADS IDE in the context of that project), e.g., using the CEP platform Apama. Figure 1 depicts the graphical representation of a state machine that is currently used (with the existing ThingML tool) for modeling the behavior of a smart Air Conditioner using the data that comes through asynchronous message passing from a temperature sensor in the room.},

abstract={Blockchain-based distributed computing platforms enable the trusted execution of computation—defined in the form of smart contracts—without trusted agents. Smart contracts are envisioned to have a variety of applications, ranging from financial to IoT asset tracking. Unfortunately, the development of smart contracts has proven to be extremely error prone. In practice, contracts are riddled with security vulnerabilities comprising a critical issue since bugs are by design non-fixable and contracts may handle financial assets of significant value. To facilitate the development of secure smart contracts, we have created the FSolidM framework, which allows developers to define contracts as finite state machines (FSMs) with rigorous and clear semantics. FSolidM provides an easy-to-use graphical editor for specifying FSMs, a code generator for creating Ethereum smart contracts, and a set of plugins that developers may add to their FSMs to enhance security and functionality. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) aims to bring every object, such as smart cameras, wearable devices, etc., online, hence generating massive amounts of data that can submerge storage systems. The Cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet these requirements, particularly in some critical applications (as health monitoring, emergency response, etc.) that require low latency, and delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact their performances. To overcome this limitation, Edge paradigms, as Fog computing, Edge computing and Mobile Cloud computing, have been proposed, where cloud services are extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion. This paper proposes a software architecture supporting the modelling of Edge computing dedicated systems. The current situation of emerging Edge paradigms is analyzed in detail. An approach based on software component technology is proposed and applied using Fractal components model, which can specify semantics of every-changing dynamic and distributed integration of software components. Furthermore, a case study of the patient monitoring system (PMS-EDGE) along with its application model and network topology is expounded. Copyright © by the paper’s authors.},

abstract={The development of Batik industry depends on its industrial developments and is strongly related to entrepreneurship. With development of batik businessmen becomes a priority, there is a need to keep reinventing while keeping the priority in mind. Therefore, failure in this development would in future causes a trickle-down effect of struggles in adapting to market changes. Thus, it is proving a hindrance in making and distributing batik. This paper discusses challenges pertaining to entrepreneurship development of Batik Industry in Indonesia. The study was carried out in LAWEYAN, Indonesia with targeted respondents of batik entrepreneurs. This study is qualitative in nature, with analysis done on survey result of interviewing 22 batik businessmen in LAWEYAN. The purpose of this study is to identify the challenges and potentials in development of LAWEYAN Batik in Indonesia. The challenges discussed include three components, namely: 1) Labour component, 2) Marketing component and 3) Finance component. Based on analysis on those components, this study found that there is a need training session especially for new starter, along with stronger capital support, infrastructure support and a need for workshop designed integrated with Internet of Things (IoT). © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

abstract={Waste disposal and recycling is becoming one of the main problems in Western countries. Improving both recycling culture among citizenship and waste collection and treatment logistics is critical to augment the percentage of waste being recycled. In this paper we present STERLING, an initiative that aims to help in both fields. STERLING is a framework composed by a low-cost, low-energy sensor installed in recycling containers to measure fill level and other physical parameters. The sensor is activated magnetically each time the container lid is opened by a user. Instead of directly sending this information to a cloud-based server, our sensor broadcasts a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packet to the surrounding area. An App running in the mobile phone of the user performs two actions: To capture this information, re-sending it to the cloud-based server, and to assign credit to this particular user for having used the recycling container. In this way, users are rewarded for using the container, and the infrastructure benefits from cost-free communications from the container to the server. In this paper we will describe our idea in detail, showing how it can be used to develop a rewarding schema that encourages recycling. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract={Purpose: With the advent of the smart home, where connectivity is facilitated by the internet of things, the provision of guest technologies in hotel service delivery has acquired greater significance. This ubiquity of technology implies that hotels need to view their technological offerings as facilitating guest’s broader lifestyles, and not just services in isolated spaces. This study aims to examine the role of “home” as a socio-technological unit, and how customers’ ownership of technologies at home affects evaluations of guest technologies at hotels. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from a sample of US lodging consumers using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Partial least squares, which is a component-based structural equation modeling technique with SmartPLS 3.2, is used to test the hypotheses and meet the study’s objectives. Findings: The findings show that hotel guest technologies should be of a higher standard than those at home, for guests to be satisfied with them. This relationship was robust across all hotel types, and both leisure and business visitation. Also, satisfaction with guest technologies has a relatively stronger impact on customer satisfaction in mid-scale and economy hotels compared to that in upscale and luxury hotels. Research limitations/implications: By empirically validating “home” as a frame of reference in the evaluations of hospitality experiences, it opens up the potential for future research to study how home affects the evaluation of the hospitality experience as a whole. Practical implications: Hotels need to identify viable technologies that have the potential to become mainstream, and be ahead of customers in the technology adoption curve. Originality/value: This study is the first to look at home as a conceptual entity that is integral to hospitality using a socio-psychological lens, and evaluates its impact on evaluations of guest technologies at hotels. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Learning about sensor technology and actuator early is important as a step towards knowing and introducing of advanced technologies based on Internet of Things (IoT). The difficulties are how to learn sensor technology and move the actuator with accessing General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) of Raspberry Pi 3 Platforms using programming language syntax which often confusing and difficult to understand. To help people learning IoT by using Raspberry Pi 3 with an interesting Android apps, we believe that this learning module can integrate about the ease and attractiveness of IoT System Editor based on Android apps. This research create a mobile programming apps based on Android which people can build IoT project easily with GUI without program and middleware based on Raspberry Pi to connect between apps and hardware with especially task to manage data communication, data flow, and device driver. Hopefully new developer can develop the IoT application easily by using Android mobile visual programming that combined with Raspberry Pi 3 platform. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this article a data gathering algorithm is proposed for collecting data from sensors using a mobile sink. It reduces the data gathering tour length. Mobile sinks collect data from the sensors directly in single hop to prolong sensors’ lifetime. Our proposed algorithm is more suitable for the network which is clustered into multiple connected components. A mobile sink is a vehicle equipped with a transceiver to collect data from sensors. It collects data from sensors while moving in the sensory field. A novel component based single hop data gathering algorithm (CBSHDG) is proposed to minimize the tour length of the network. It ensures that all sensors are reachable to the mobile sink within single hop. A single hop data gathering collects data directly from the sensors without using relay node and prolonged the network lifetime. Our proposed algorithm first finds an ordering among the components so that total tour length is less. Thereafter, a component based polling point selection algorithm (CBPPSA) is introduced to find a set of polling points within each component. It ensures that every sensor is reachable from one of the polling points. Our proposed algorithm is simulated in MATLAB to demonstrate its performance. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Autonomous Systems (e.g., self-driving vehicles) and autonomous systems network are becoming increasingly more feasible for real-world deployment with the advent of the Internet-of-Things (IoTs) and advances in sensing and machine reasoning technologies. Autonomous vehicle networks are system-ofsystems and are amenable to model-based analysis and design. This paper presents a model-based approach for analyzing and designing resilient SoS subject to a variety of disruptions. The specific SoS addressed in this paper is an autonomous (i.e., self-driving) vehicle network. The approach employs deterministic and probabilistic modeling, and use-case patterns to model SoS behavior and explore mechanisms for introducing resilience into systems and SoS. Exemplar use cases for self-driving vehicles are provided to illustrate key aspects of the overall approach. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018. All rights are reserved.},

abstract={Sensor networks are a fast-evolving technology used for a variety of applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to cyberphysical systems (CPS) and IoT, including applications designed to support smart cities. The widespread use of sensor networks rises new challenges to data management and storage. The development of data storage systems is a hard task due to the specific nature of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the lack of a common general purpose development framework. Software component models provide an appropriate level of system abstraction, reducing the development complexity and improving productivity. In this paper we propose RCBM, a Reusable Component-based Model for wireless sensor network storage simulation. RCBM promotes software reuse from existing components to improve the efficiency of system development and evaluation. RCBM has been implemented on the NS2 simulator and experimental results show that RCBM is more flexible than previous component-based models for WSNs. Due to its general-purpose approach, RCBM can be applied to develop simulation code for a wide range of WSN storage models, reducing the development effort. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Various Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as home automation and disaster early warning systems, are being introduced in various areas of human life and business. Today, a common method for delivery of such applications is via component-based software engineering disciplines based on cloud computing technologies such as containers. However, there are still numerous technological challenges to be solved particularly related to the time-critical Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of such applications. Runtime variations in the workload intensity as the amount of service tasks to be processed may radically affect the application performance perceived by the end-users or lead to the underutilization of resources. In order to assure the QoS of these containerized applications, monitoring is required at both container and application levels. Currently, there is a great lack of such multi-level monitoring systems. In this study, we present an architecture and implementation of a multi-level monitoring framework to ensure system health and adapt an IoT application in response to varying quantity, size and computational requirements of arrival requests. In this work, cloud application adaptation possibility includes horizontal scaling of container-based application instances. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={We present Component-Based Simplex Architecture (CBSA), a new framework for assuring the runtime safety of component-based cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CBSA integrates Assume-Guarantee (A-G) reasoning with the core principles of the Simplex control architecture to allow component-based CPSs to run advanced, uncertified controllers while still providing runtime assurance that A-G contracts and global properties are satisfied. In CBSA, multiple Simplex instances, which can be composed in a nested, serial or parallel manner, coordinate to assure system-wide properties. Combining A-G reasoning and the Simplex architecture is a challenging problem that yields significant benefits. By utilizing A-G contracts, we are able to compositionally determine the switching logic for CBSAs, thereby alleviating the state explosion encountered by other approaches. Another benefit is that we can use A-G proof rules to decompose the proof of system-wide safety assurance into sub-proofs corresponding to the componentbased structure of the system architecture. We also introduce the notion of coordinated switching between Simplex instances, a key component of our compositional approach to reasoning about CBSA switching logic. We illustrate our framework with a component-based control system for a ground rover. We formally prove that the CBSA for this system guarantees energy safety (the rover never runs out of power), and collision freedom (the rover never collides with a stationary obstacle). We also consider a CBSA for the rover that guarantees mission completion: All target destinations visited within a prescribed amount of time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={End-user programming in smart homes addresses tasks that range from very simple to very complex. In this study we investigate how task complexity impacts performance when using two different visual programing representations: form-filling and data-flow programming. We invited 16 participants to create rules to solve smart-home situations of varying complexity and analyzed their completion rates for the two visual programming representations. We identify the following areas of difficulty for programming novices in our smart home scenario: choosing and connecting triggers and their specifications, and using Boolean operators. Both visual representations enabled users to specify complex rules, with advantages in different areas. They indicate that overall task complexity might be less decisive for performance than complexity of triggers and Boolean operators. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to produce several changes in the ways computer technologies influence our life and in how we interact with them. Computation embedded in interconnected 'smart' devices surrounding us is composing an emerging infrastructure able to sense, infer and actuate in the world in unprecedented ways, changing businesses and our everyday life. Among the several challenges that such reality is introducing, there are those related to how end-users will be able to tailor their own technology. For instance, the combined diversity of devices, individual preferences, needs and contexts of use makes it unlikely, if not impossible, for any designer to address all users' needs and preferences beforehand. Moreover, these needs and preferences are likely to change, following the dynamics of everyday life and the idiosyncratic moods, ideas, and goals of individuals. End-User Development (EUD) is an approach to address end-users' specific needs and preferences by enabling them to tailor computer technologies by themselves using simple (e.g. setting parameters) and advanced techniques (e.g. macro and visual programming). With such approach, technology can be tailored by end-users to address unanticipated and changing needs during use-Time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Most connected objects feature very limited capabilities that present challenges in terms of data processing and connectivity. In addition, heterogeneity of smart Internet-of-Things devices also causes interoperability problems. These limitations lead to strong hardware and software constraints that must be considered as early as possible during the design process. In this paper, we introduce a smart object component-based model to build complex smart objects by composition mechanisms in a similar way to Web service compositions. The smart object model extends artifact types and describes its structure and behavior in terms of attribute value pair, state-based lifecycle and services. Moreover, we propose a formal specification based on the intuitive multiplicative segment of intuitionistic linear logic not only to express consumable resources but also to automate composition from logical proofs. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Industrial products tend to be customized by third-parties for different use cases. This is currently supported by adding external Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) to installations. As IoT software ecosystems become wide-spread, the need for such hardware will decrease. However, removing the controllers opens the challenge of configuring distributed industrial installations. This paper argues for modeling application requirements on industrial installations so that they can be evaluated automatically based on information about targeted installations. GIMLE, a visual language for modeling application requirements using expressive domain knowledge, is proposed. GIMLE enables modeling requirements on physical features of installations, which hasn't received significant attention in the related work. A study with domain experts is used to reflect on the proposed process. The scalability of the visual language is evaluated using a model for a real-world application. The support for reuse of requirements enabled us to build models that can add support for new installations without significant changes and with a slower increase in size the more components can be reused. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={NDN data plane relays name-based packets by maintaining three tables: Content Store, Pending Interest Table and Forwarding Information Base. The three tables require similar but different schemes to be matched and updated in a nearly per-packet fashion, thus individual data structure is required for each table. In this work, we propose a unified data structure of name lookup for all three tables, namely CTrie, aiming at reducing the computational cost from three pipelined lookup rounds down to one unified round. CTrie extends the original Patricia trie to a combinational trie structure built from both component-based and byte-based hierarchical names. We compared CTrie with other approaches in speed and memory. The results show that CTrie runs 3.2 times faster and consumes about 38% memory than the current ones in terms of the whole data plane. CTrie fits for all application scenarios of NDN and especially well for IoT like lightweight-deployed scenarios. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) enables connected objects to capture, communicate, and collect information over the network through a multitude of sensors, setting the foundation for applications such as smart grids, smart cars, and smart cities. In this context, large scale analytics is needed to extract knowledge and value from the data produced by these sensors. The ability to perform analytics on these data, however, is highly limited by the difficulties of collecting labels. Indeed, the machine learning techniques used to perform analytics rely upon data labels to learn and to validate results. Historically, crowdsourcing platforms have been used to gather labels, yet they cannot be directly used in the IoT because of poor human readability of sensor data. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a framework for sensor data analytics which leverages the power of crowdsourcing through gamification to acquire sensor data labels. The framework uses gamification as a socially engaging vehicle and as a way to motivate users to participate in various labelling tasks. To demonstrate the framework proposed, a case study is also presented. Evaluation results show the framework can successfully translate gamification events into sensor data labels. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={A wide range of mobile devices, e.g., wireless sensor nodes, RFID tags and smartphones, gradually coalesces into the Internet of Things (IoT). Debugging and optimizing such systems is challenging and necessary to realize the foreseen vision. In this paper, we describe our endeavor to build and adapt a testbed enabling the analysis of different scenarios involving mobile elements. Instead of creating a versatile but expansive testbed based on free-ranging robots, we developed a set of specialized components based on model trains. Our goal was to save costs while providing repeatable and accurate experiments where the movement of the tested devices is not provided by battery powered platforms. %This endeavor did not come without trouble and more realistic requirements changed our planned path. The contribution of this paper is to describe the iterative design and realization process for each testbed component and to quantify the trade-offs between different approaches. We discuss how our solutions evolved due to the constraints of the real experiments that were carried out on the various instances of the testbed, with a particular focus on the experience we acquired in the process and the lessons we have learned along the way. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={High productivity embedded network software is required to run embedded systems within the Internet of Things (IoT). Tomakomai InterNETworking (TINET) is a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol stack for use in embedded systems. Although TINET is a compact protocol stack, it comprises many complex source codes and is difficult to maintain, extend, and analyze. To improve scalability and configurability, this paper proposes TINET componentized with the Toyohashi Open Platform for Embedded Real-time Systems (TOPPERS) embedded component system (TINET+TECS), a component-based TCP/IP protocol stack for embedded systems. This component-based TINET offers software developers high productivity through variable network buffer sizes and the ability to add or remove TCP (or UDP) functionality. TINET+TECS utilizes a dynamic TECS component connection method to satisfy the original TINET specifications. The results of an experimental comparison between the proposed component-based and original TINETs show that the execution time and memory consumption overhead are reduced and the configurability is improved. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Many new Internet of Things (IoT) applications such a disaster early warning systems, video-streaming, automated driving and similar, are increasingly being built by using advanced component based software engineering approaches. Software components can include various executable images, such as container or Virtual Machine images, scripts and others. Achieving adequate Quality of Service (QoS) for such applications is still a challenging issue due to runtime variations in running conditions intrinsic to the cloud, edge and fog environments. These types of systems should therefore be continuously monitored and hence adapted at various levels including infrastructure, container and application levels. In this work, we present an adaptation method using a new Incremental Learning approach based on Multi-Level Monitoring data. The method dynamically generates a set of rules representing a performance prediction model that allow us to find potential performance bottlenecks and then propose suitable application adaptation actions. Adaptation possibilities in this work include (1) live-migration of application components (such as containers) from the current infrastructure to another one with different characteristics, such as CPU, memory, disk or bandwidth capacity, and (2) dynamic horizontal or vertical scaling of container-based application instances to offer better fitted resource capacities. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={As the number of dual-income household's increases, time spent by parents with children has been decreasing. To solve this issue, we have designed our system, Fam-On Platform. This platform is intended that it has increased the quantity of time by making parents recognized the lack of parenting time through time measurement. On the other hands, showing the amount of parenting time, it tries to decrease the imbalance of parenting time between fathers and mother as well. In this process, we manufactured physical wearable watch devices to promote children's interest and provide direct feedback to the family. Also, we tried to improve family bond by family-sharing time, providing contents to share among family members through application including gamification elements. We have completed a prototype of our platform and conducted pilot test targeting one child. We could gain the results we intended and find issues we need to improve further.},

abstract={A cyber-physical system (CPS) is an integration of computation with physical processes whose behavior is defined by both computational and physical parts of the system. In this paper, we present a view of the challenges and opportunities for design automation of CPS. We identify a combination of characteristics that define the challenges unique to the design automation of CPS. We then present selected promising advances in depth, focusing on four foundational directions: combining model-based and data-driven design methods; design for human-in-the-loop systems; component-based design with contracts, and design for security and privacy. These directions are illustrated with examples from two application domains: smart energy systems and next-generation automotive systems. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Among water management policies, the preservation and the saving of energy demand in water supply and treatment systems play key roles. When focusing on energy, the customary metric to determine the performance of water supply systems is linked to the definition of component-based energy indicators. This approach is unfit to account for interactions occurring among system elements or between the system and its environment. On the other hand, the development of information technology has led to the availability of increasing large amount of data, typically gathered from distributed sensor networks in so-called smart grids. In this context, data intensive methodologies address the possibility of using complex network modeling approaches, and advocate the issues related to the interpretation and analysis of large amount of data produced by smart sensor networks. In this perspective, the present work aims to use data intensive techniques in the energy analysis of a water management network. The purpose is to provide new metrics for the energy rating of the system and to be able to provide insights into the dynamics of its operations. The study applies neural network as a tool to predict energy demand, when using flowrate and vibration data as predictor variables. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Many Internet of Things (IoT) technologies interconnect physical sensors, actuators, and heterogeneous computing devices within the existing Internet infrastructure, which make our life more convenient. ArduTalk is a graphical programming environment based on IoTtalk, which aims to develop internetworking Arduino applications for multiple Arduino boards. Therefore, sensors and actuators can be plugged in different Arduino boards, and the user can utilize ArduTalk to arbitrarily link and re-link sensors to actuators to create dilferent applications for dilferent purposes, which is a very convenient way to develop IoT applications especially for beginners. Performance measurement shows that the actuator still has a quick response time when the actuator is triggered by a sensor through ArduTalk. © 2017 Univeristy of Split, FESB.},

abstract={Public buildings are a particularly challenging category of buildings to address for energy conservation due to lack of occupant motives and lack of individual accountability among others. In this paper, we describe an IoT-enabled gamification approach to change energy-consumption behaviors and reduce energy waste in public buildings. This will be assisted by the energy-consumption disaggregation at the device and at the individual employee levels through the design of an IoT infrastructure consisting of multi-channel smart meters, NFC tags, BLE beacons and the user smartphones. Based on our approach, employees will be motivated to improve their energy-consumption behaviors by means of peer-pressure based on a team competition and by means of direct (non-monetary) rewards. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Małopolska Educational Cloud (MEC) is a unique undertaking in terms of employing simultaneously a variety of modern and closely integrated ICT (cloud computing, social media, and multimedia) to support unusual collaboration scenarios involving high schools and universities. The environment leverages technologies designed for enterprises, which are suitable in terms of scalability, but do not perfectly address the specifics of MEC environment. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the application of Internet of Things (IoT) approach that would both improve education and streamline organization. From the variety of educational activities implemented in MEC, our area of focus is multi-party audiovisual collaboration during online classes. The scale and geographic scattering of participants makes this particular activity technically challenging and, at the same time, promising when considering application of IoT approach. In our opinion, extension of existing MEC infrastructure with IoT-compatible appliances could result in better organization of the collaboration and improve involvement of students in the educational process. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={A formal framework for modelling and simulation of parallel systems named ProjectDEVS is presented. The objective of this framework is to apply a Model-Based System Engineering approach to the development of simulation products for cyber-physical embedded systems. It is intended for the design and automated deployment of virtual prototypes. Models are constructed by coupling concurrent components exchanging data through ports and executed by various simulation schemes, namely simulators. This paper focuses on the integration of a Time Petri Net implementation of a parallel simulator into the framework. The semantics of the parallel simulator is formally described using timed transition system to verify the correctness of the implementation. Then, a model with its simulator can be model checked against formal specification and be rapidly deployed on FPGA or PC via code generators. © 2017},

abstract={The population of elderly people and disabled has exponentially increased thanks to advances of medicine which allow people to live longer and healthier than the previous generations. In this context, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications which promotes independent living is more necessary than ever. Also, the Internet of Things (IoT) proliferates as the dominant technological paradigm for the open deployment of networked smart objects in the environment, including physical things, smart devices and entire applications. In our work, a primary objective was the delivery of an AAL framework on the top of smart objects which uses the full range of IoT technologies. Very early, it became evident that the demand of personalized applications in the context of AAL is very intense. This is mainly due to the highly individualized and fluid nature of the required applications. Along these lines, we focus in providing an end-user programming environment to empower carers, possibly the elderly and family themselves, with the necessary tools to easily and quickly craft, test, modify and deploy smart object applications they would like to have in their everyday life. In this paper, we support personalized automations using smart objects for outdoor daily activities, outside the elderly's protected home environment. We initially outline possible useful mobility scenarios. Then, we elaborate on the visual tools we are developing, followed by a brief case study using them. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Interface automaton is a promising approach to model the temporal behaviors of system components, and its extension has been used to specify the security properties of component based systems. Currently, the formal properties of interface automata have not be certified with machine-checked proof by any proof assistant. In this work, we propose a Coq-library of interface automata which is developed in purpose to certify security properties of component-based cyber-physical systems, with an emphasis upon developing compositional verification of information flow security for cyber-physical applications. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={As IoT/robotics research and applications expand explosively into many domains in computing, information, and control systems, schools and universities must prepare students to understand and be able to program IoT devices and robots. However, programming IoT and physical devices is hard and depends on good understanding of hardware and low-level programming. Workflow and visual programming environments have been developed to address this issue, including MIT App Inventor, Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio and VPL (Visual Programming Language), and Intel Service Orchestration Layer. We have developed a new visual programming language and its development environment: ASU VIPLE (Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Language Environment). ASU VIPLE is specifically developed to support different device platforms. It supports LEGO EV3 and all IoT devices based on an open architecture. ASU VIPLE integrates engineering design process, workflow, fundamental programming concepts, control flow, parallel computing, and event-driven programming seamlessly into the curriculum. It has been pilot tested at Arizona State University in summers 2015 and 2016, and is now taught in an ASU regular class, Introduction to Engineering. It has been adopted by numerous universities around the world. This paper focuses on the mathematical model of ASU VIPLE. π-calculus is used to describe the basic activities in VIPLE, as well as the workflow defined by the basic activities. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Interactive, smart objects - customized to individuals and uses - are central to many movements, such as tangibles, the internet of things (IoT), and ubiquitous computing. Yet, rapid prototyping both the form and function of these custom objects can be problematic, particularly for those with limited electronics or programming experience. Designers often need to embed custom circuitry; program its workings; and create a form factor that not only reflects the desired user experience but can also house the required circuitry and electronics. To mitigate this, we created Pineal, a design tool that lets end-users: (1) modify 3D models to include a smart watch or phone as its heart; (2) specify high-level interactive behaviours through visual programming; and (3) have the phone or watch act out such behaviours as the objects' "smarts". Furthermore, a series of prototypes show how Pineal exploits mobile sensing and output, and automatically generates 3D printed form-factors for rich, interactive, objects. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={IoT is a technology that provides service and shares information through connecting real objects through wireless and wired networks. Various services and information divided through IoT based environment device cooperation not only increases the quality of life in individuals but also has become an important issue in the development of various industrial fields. IoT service development appropriate for applicable industries and personal requirements is required. This study suggests a system that can provide a web service list appropriate for the user when selecting service by using a concept of applying and collecting various forms of information created in IoT environment while using web service. The suggested method applies user IoT information with traditional web service search to include the advantages of the existing search methods and services that the user needs. Thus, user friendly service selection that can increase the efficiency of service use is created compared with the traditional provider centered service provision environment. The study defines usable service properties and derives IoT service components. Based on this, we suggest an IoT information based web service search system and algorithm. Diverse user information models collected and created through IoT collector are provided with user requirements during service selection and based on user IoT information, useful service for individual user environment can be discovered and provided. The suggested method utilizes information models created through IoT device elements to suggest a system model that can be utilized for various requirements and rapidly changing services. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={This paper shows the concept and design of an ongoing project about "behavior change", that is one of the keywords for realizing a sustainable society based on information technology such as IoT and AI. "Stand" function that Apple Watch has is a touchstone of the arrival of a new age. The watch commands a human to stand up or meditate. It is a start of intervention to our behavior from AI. However, it is not so bad because we know that this suggestion must be good for our health. Based on this experience, we started an empirical research on behavior change that consists of activity recognition, just-in-time intervention, and gamification. © 2017 ACM.},

We propose an innovative platform that consists of a versatile set of sensors and actuators, controlled by utilizing a userfriendly visual programming language through a mobile phone interface, or by utilizing a representational state transfer application programming interface for more advanced users. Suggested methods form the foundation of problem-based learning, by emphasizing hands-on experimental assignments and activities, and collaborative learning. We present the software and hardware architecture of the system, and case studies for utilizing different control modes. Consequently, students can improve their understanding of basic robotic concepts by observing real-Time response and feedback of the actuator and sensor modules integrated in the robotic platform. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This study was based on the Internet of Things (IoT) architecture to propose an ultrasonic Morse code electronic lock for a home access control and safety system. Audio components of a smartphone were employed for ultrasonic Morse coding. Once the password of the receiver is confirmed to be correct through a microphone and micro-controller decoding, the details about the unlocking personnel and unlocking actions are uploaded to cloud server via Wi-Fi. In addition, because noise frequency of an environment influences ultrasonic Morse code determination, this study proposed the use of Moving Average of Median Filter to process microphone sound signals so that the unlocking device is free from environmental noise influences. This study consists of four sections: 1. Ultrasonic Morse code generator; 2. Ultrasonic Morse code decoder; 3. Digital filter; and 4. MediaTek Cloud Sandbox integrated cloud monitoring system. The experimental results indicated that the proposed electronic lock can remain fully functional in a noisy environment, including coding, transmitting, receiving, filtering, decoding, uploading, and remote monitoring processes. Moreover, the operating interface is simple and user friendly, making it applicable to users of varying ages. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Fog computing brings cloud closer to end-users and data sources by enabling computation at the edge of the network. Low latency is the main benefit. IoT applications are often latency-sensitive. Such applications may be provisioned as component-based in a hybrid cloud/fog environment with components spanning cloud and fog. This will enable placing some of its components in the fog domain closer to the IoT devices, and consequently reduce the latency. However, provisioning applications in hybrid cloud/fog environment is still manual today. Existing PaaS do not support interacting with fog nodes, at the edge, for applications' components provisioning. This demo shows the key features of the hybrid Platform as-a-Service (PaaS) we have designed for IoT applications provisioning in cloud and fog environments. Three goals are assigned to the demo: (1) How applications can be designed and developed in such environments, (2) how the hybrid PaaS deploys the applications' components across cloud and fog nodes, and (3) how it executes and manages them using appropriate orchestration techniques. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Design-by-Contract approaches have proved essential for the development of complex cyber-physical systems with many parallel and heterogeneous components. The heterogeneity requires separation of design concerns by introducing multi-view contracts to support compositional design and verification. In some model-based development methodologies the alternative design views are supposed to be addressed by different formal methods each being most relevant to a view. In practical design the clean separation of views is not always obvious or even possible due to the dependencies and semantic overlaps between the views. Although the overlap of views introduces some redundancy, it can be turned beneficial for simplifying the design integration if explicitly addressed by the co-use of formal methods. In this paper we specify the component contracts by Event-B and Uppaal Timed Automata used respectively for behavioural and timing views and show how to combine them to merge different views in contracts. Relying on our previous results on the mapping between Event-B and Uppaal Timed Automata we extend this mapping to views of a contract and provide the verification conditions for each view separately as well as for their compatibility. We demonstrate the relevance of the approach with a Multi Robot System coordination case-study addressing the interdependencies of behavioural and timing constraints exposed in the cooperative multi-robot coverage problem. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Visual programming has transformed the art of programming in recent years. Several organizations are in race to develop novel ideas to run visual programming in multiple domains with Internet of Things. IoT, being the most emerging area of computing, needs substantial contribution from the visual programming paradigm for its technological propagation. This paper surveys visual programming languages being served for application development, especially in Internet of Things field. 13 such languages are visited from several popular research-electronic databases (e.g., IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Springer Link, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Postscapes) and compared under four key attributes such as programming environment, license, project repository, and platform supports. Grouped into two segments, open source and proprietary platform, these visual languages pertain few crucial challenges that have been elaborated in this literature. The main goal of this paper is to present existing VPLs per their parametric proforma to enable naïve developers and researchers in the field of IoT to choose appropriate variant of VPL for particular type of application. It is also worth validating the usability and adaptability of VPLs that is essential for selection of beneficiary in terms of IoT. © 2017 Partha Pratim Ray.},

abstract={This paper presents a graphical programming interface that enables non-technical professionals to program robots. Increasingly, robots are used by non-technical persons, such as service workers, therapists or marketers and graphical programming enables them to adjust robots to the situational needs through intuitive but expressive ways. We present our implementation of graphical environment for programming a set of internet-of-things (IoT) devices and robots for therapists of autism. It is based on Robot Operating System (ROS) and Snap, and is called Robokol. Compared to previous solutions our system is easily extensible to new devices, with an interface enabling plug-and-play device discoverability and uses nonproprietary, well-known tools. We detail two use cases of our interface, one where therapists of autism create sense-act loops for sensory therapy employing robot-like or IoT devices, and second where Robokol is used to create interfaces for Wizard-of-Oz scenario with robots. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) promotes independent living, while the Internet of Things (IoT) proliferates as the dominant technology for the deployment of pervasive smart objects. In this work, we focus on the delivery of an AAL framework utilizing IoT technologies, while addressing the demand for very customized automations due to the diverse and fluid (can change over time) user requirements. The latter turns the idea of a general-purpose application suite to fit all users mostly unrealistic and suboptimal. Driven by the popularity of visual programming tools, especially for children, we focused in directly enabling end-users, including carers, family or friends, even the elderly/disabled themselves, to easily craft and modify custom automations. In this paper we firstly discuss scenarios of highly personalized AAL automations through smart objects, and then elaborate on the capabilities of the visual tools we are currently developing on a basis of a brief case study. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as automotive systems, are starting to include sophisticated machine learning (ML) components. Their correctness, therefore, depends on properties of the inner ML modules. While learning algorithms aim to generalize from examples, they are only as good as the examples provided, and recent efforts have shown that they can produce inconsistent output under small adversarial perturbations. This raises the question: can the output from learning components can lead to a failure of the entire CPS? In this work, we address this question by formulating it as a problem of falsifying signal temporal logic (STL) specifications for CPS with ML components. We propose a compositional falsification framework where a temporal logic falsifier and a machine learning analyzer cooperate with the aim of finding falsifying executions of the considered model. The efficacy of the proposed technique is shown on an automatic emergency braking system model with a perception component based on deep neural networks. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Recently, we are witnessing high advancement in the robotics field. However, the barrier to entry level to the robotics world remains very high, because it requires technical knowledge in several fields such as electronics and coding. Therefore, various efforts are being made to make creating robots simpler and enable a larger audience to enter this area. This paper presents a brief overview on these efforts and an initiative to promote the Internet of Things by proposing an intuitive low-cost prototyping platform based on recycled electronics. The proposed solution is composed of a recycled smartphone and IOIO board, the latter gives to the smartphone the capability to be interconnected with hardware modules and sensors. The proposed solution makes the robots' programming easier through Blockly's open-source visual programming interface.

abstract={Increased interconnectivity of Cyber-Physical Systems, by design or otherwise, increases the cyber attack surface and attack vectors. It is not always desirable to do cyber risk assessment of such interconnected systems by cyber attacks on the entire system. This paper presents a formal approach for simulating cyber effects for cyber risk assessment of subcomponents of such systems using a control component based on Discrete EVent System (DEVS) models. Our approach first separates components of a system that may be directly attacked, from components of the system whose behavior need to be studied for the impact originating from those attacks. The cyber attack effects are simulated through interception of communications among the separated components. We define the types of cyber effects, and show an example of how an attack may be simulated with a control component through a case study. ©2017 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={This paper investigates how and whether existing or current design tools, assist and support designers and engineers in the early-phases of ideation and conceptualization stages of design and engineering processes. The research explores how fluidly and/or congruously technology affords cognitive, emotive, gesture-based shape-And-form transformation and stimulates externalization within a hybrid design tool environment (HDTE). Meta-cognitive, emotive, gestural, sensorial, multidimensional interaction through exploration, translation and manifestation within a contextual blended environment is studied to enhance representation, stimulate choice-Architecture and foster decision-making. Current and novel hybrid design tool developments and experiments illustrate the promise of hybridization for natural computing and unobtrusive designtools (HDT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS). Put into perspective; a proposed framework of robust interaction design (IxD), gamification and affective computing (e.g. emotion) to improve and intensify user-experience (UX) and userengagement (UE) is presented. The paper concludes by considering the allowance for possible novel routes to increase the scope and forging of links on prevailing frames of humancomputer interaction (HCI). © 2017 ASME.},

abstract={A ZigBee based wireless sensor network is implemented in this paper which is of low-cost solar-powered air quality monitoring system. The main objective of the proposed architecture is to interfacing various sensors to measure the sensor analog data and displayed in LabVIEW on the monitor using the graphical user interface (GUI). The real time ambient air quality monitoring in smart cities is of greater significance for the health of people. The wireless network sensor nodes are placed at different traffic signals in the smart cities which collect and report real-time data on different gases which are present in the environment such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), methane (CH4) and humidity. The proposed system allows smart cities to monitor air quality conditions on a desktop/laptop computer through an application designed using graphical programming based LabVIEW software and provides an alert if the air quality characteristics exceed acceptable levels. The sensor network was successfully tested on the campus of the institute of aeronautical engineering, Hyderabad. The sensor data are indicated by different indicators on the front panel of LabVIEW and also different charts are plotted with respect to time and amplitude which explains the severity of polluted areas.},

abstract={Simulation modelling has an ever increasing importance for complex systems. Manufacturing and related material flow or logistic systems are typical fields of application. Latest trends such as Cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0 give a significant boost to simulation modelling as these require a digital model of the system. Complex manufacturing and related material flow systems are subject to frequent changes and pose a Big Data problem, which raises stronger requirements regarding self-adaptiveness. Conventional simulation models are to be adapted only via user interaction. Previous research steps have concentrated on the establishment of a novel simulation model structure, the so called "Jellyfish" model which unifies layout and process-type simulation models. Visualization of both aspects simultaneously enables interacting users to better understand the systems' operation compared to the conventional models. The current paper focuses on the adaptive capability of the new model. We have concentrated on the hardest type of adaptation, the structural adaptation. In this paper, an ontology-driven component based approach is presented and explained further through an example. Application of automated ontology-matching in simulation environment is a novel approach enabling the simulation model to adapt its structure without the necessity of manual interaction. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={The wildfires caused by human occupation is one of the factors that most contributes to deforestation of conservation areas, resulting in a number of issues for ecological systems. Premature fire detections lead to the elimination or reduction of the damage that will be caused by a fire incident. Wireless sensor networks have been shown to be a good alternative for environmental monitoring applications, as they can collect and send information in real time, such as humidity, wind, and temperature of various parts of the forest. Due to problems such as power limitation, communication failure, and loss of nodes, the network topology is constantly changing, requiring mechanisms to achieve self-organization and fault tolerance. This article proposes the development of a model and application in self-organizing and fault-tolerant wireless sensor networks for fire detection in conservation areas. To achieve self-organization and fault tolerance, we rely on encouraged local interactions between neighboring nodes that monitor the same region and the coordination of tasks, through a supervisor node, equipped with a framework for developing component-based fault-tolerant applications. For the analysis and validation of both model and application, it was simulated 60 events in the network of sensors in a real scenario using the simulator Sinalgo. The results were classified as True (partial or absolute) or False (partial or absolute). In all, 45% of consensus identified a possible fault in the application and in only 35% there was absolute consensus. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Vehicles are not just a means of transportation anymore, but they are also moving entities that collect and transmit a great amount of data, captured by sensors from the internals of the vehicle and from its environment as well. These data extended with smartphone sensors can be a stable base for smart car-based infocommunication systems. There are two main interfaces to extract the data from a vehicle: OBD-II (On-board Diagnostics) and CAN bus (Controller Area Network bus). This paper introduces an advanced measurement tool, called ObdCanCompare. The purpose of this tool is to provide an environment to compare these data streams in real time and conclude how and which interface can be used for derivation of driving decisions. It also enables creating business intelligence reports using the SensorHUB-based backend, which is our data collection and service development for sensor networks, smart devices and cloud-based backend environments. Results show that the OBD-II interface is quite accurate compared to CAN bus, in order to demonstrate this we have created the Social Driving application as a socio-cognitive ICT pilot application that displays vehicle data to users from OBD-II and enables to compare usage statistics of different drivers in the network as a socio-cognitive gamification. ©2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={In this paper, we present a case study for designing a social platform towards environmental sustainability based on Internet-of-Things. The case study we investigate encourages low carbon communities, in particular, to aim for a car-free city. A car-free city promises to make our society more sustainable; however, people must be guided to choose a desirable lifestyle. We will show how our design framework helps to build a better car-free city without affecting citizens’ success. We also show an augmented bicycle prototype that is an Internet of Things (IoT)-enhanced bicycle for promoting bicycle-sharing within communities. Bicycle sharing can help to achieve a car-free city, and IoT-based daily artifacts can contribute to building an effective social platform. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Safety assurance is a major challenge in the design of modern embedded systems that has become increasingly difficult in recent years. Growing system sizes and the rise of Cyber-Physical systems confront safety engineers with large sets of configurations to be analyzed. Current approaches are usually carried out at design time and do not address the need for automated assessments in the field. With Component Fault Trees (CFTs) there exists a component-based methodology that enables an efficient modular composition of safety artifacts. The combined model is a system-level CFT that can be analyzed by means of popular Fault Tree Analysis techniques that are widely accepted in the industry. However, when composing models, their interfacing elements must be connected manually which impedes the automation of the procedure. In this work, we introduce the notion of flow types that represent a particular kind of component interaction and define a taxonomy of related failure behavior. By annotating CFTs with types, a machine-readable vocabulary is provided that allows for an automated interconnection of their interfaces. This way, the automatic composition of models according to system architecture is enabled, allowing for automated safety assessments on system-level. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using an example ethylene vaporization unit. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={Distributed sensing in combination with wireless communication techniques and self-organising deployment approaches enable Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN) to play a crucial role in our daily life. An increasing number of dynamic sensing applications have been developed, and there is a growing demand for middleware to bridge the gap between these applications and a diverse range of underlying operating systems. In this paper, we present a prototype middleware that combines a Mobile Agent-based WSN system in conjunction with the component based LooCI middleware. The system has both merits of agent-based WSN system as well as the benefits of LooCI, which include efficient energy use and providing the possibility of platform independence and component model programming language independence. The feasibility analysis along with potential implementation approaches of this system are proposed in this paper. The direction and value of on-going research based on the research work proposed in this paper is presented as well.},

abstract={The reactive paradigm recently became very popular in user-interface development: updates — such as the ones from the mouse, keyboard, or from the network — can trigger a chain of computations organised in a dependency graph, letting the underlying engine control the scheduling of these computations. In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), typical applications deploy components in distributed nodes and link their interfaces, employing a publish-subscribe architecture. The paradigm for Distributed Reactive Programming marries these two concepts, treating each distributed component as a reactive computation. However, existing approaches either require expensive synchronisation mechanisms or they do not support pipelining, i.e., allowing multiple “waves” of updates to be executed in parallel. We propose Quarp (Quality-Aware Reactive Programming), a scalable and light-weight mechanism aimed at the IoT to orchestrate components triggered by updates of data-producing components or of aggregating components. This mechanism appends meta-information to messages between components capturing the context of the data, used to dynamically monitor and guarantee useful properties of the dynamic applications. These include the so-called glitch freedom, time synchronisation, and geographical proximity. We formalise Quarp using a simple operational semantics, provide concrete examples of useful instances of contexts, and situate our approach in the realm of distributed reactive programming. © 2017, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={The monitoring of the Urban Environment requires the placement of many sensors around the City. Regular replacement of batteries is a significant additional cost. Can we enlist the public to keep the sensors charged, while keeping it entertained and engaged? The gamification of energy generation aims at inviting members of the public to interact with the energy generating device (EGD) to ensure that environmental sensors are constantly powered. As a collateral benefit, the physical and emotional involvement of the public with the EGD and the game are expected to raise their awareness and acceptance of environmental monitoring. Here we introduce the development of a hand-powered EGD and its installation on Newcastle University Campus. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={In our previous work a multi-level slow intelligence system with multiple sensors, called the TDR system, was developed [1]. It consists of interacting super-components each with different computation cycles specified by an abstract machine model. The TDR system has three major super-components: Tian (Heaven), Di (Earth) and Ren (Human), which are the essential ingredients of a human-centric psycho-physical system following the Chinese philosophy. Each super-component further consists of interacting components supported by an SIS server. In this paper we further developed a mobile TDR system for smart phones, intended for practicing health exercises such as conducting meditation. The initial experimental results and further research topics are discussed.},

abstract={Recently, the productivity of embedded systems applied to Cyber physical systems has become problematic due to their increasing complexity and scale. To improve the productivity, the mruby on TOPPERS embedded component system (TECS) framework, which employs scripting language (i.e., a lightweight Ruby) and supports component-based development, has been proposed. This paper proposes an extended framework of mruby on TECS that improves development efficiency more than the current version. In the proposed framework, a Bluetooth loader that receives an mruby bytecode, and a RiteVM scheduler that simplifies multitasking are implemented. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly gaining popularity in various critical domains like health care, critical infrastructure, and climate monitoring, where application builders have diversified development needs for programming, visualization, and simulation tools. However, these tools are designed as separate stand-alone applications. To avoid the complexity of using multiple tools, we have designed a new extensible, multi-platform, scalable, and open-source framework called PROVIZ. PROVIZ is an integrated visualization and programming framework with the following features: PROVIZ includes (1) a visualization tool that can visualize heterogeneous WSN traffic (with different packet payload formats) by parsing the data received either from a packet sniffer (e.g., a sensor-based sniffer or a commercial TI SmartRF 802.15.4 packet sniffer) or from a simulator (e.g., OMNeT); (2) a scripting language based on the TinyOS sensor network platform that aims at reducing code size and improving programming efficacy; (3) an over-the-air programming tool to securely program sensor nodes; (4) a visual programming tool with basic sensor drag-and-drop modules for generating simple WSN programs; and (5) a visual network comparison tool that analyzes packet traces of two networks to generate a juxtaposed visual comparison of contrasting network characteristics. PROVIZ also includes built-in extensible visual demo deployment capabilities that allow users to quickly craft network scenarios and share them with other users. In this work, we introduce the various features of PROVIZ's visualization and programming framework, analyze test scenarios, and discuss how all the tools can be used in sync with each other to create an all-encompassing development and test environment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={IoT developers need to integrate a variety of protocols, backend components and services; they often need to pre and post-process data as well as react to changes in the real world. Data flow programming tools have been introduced in a number of related domains to provide a flexible, but easy to use visual programming environment for rapid development. The open source Node-RED system provides such a tool for IoT applications, but is limited to executing a single flow file in a single thread. In this paper we describe the design of our system called the Front-End for Node-RED (FRED) that manages multiple instances of Node-RED for logged in users, allowing Node-RED to be used as a cloud-hosted data flow mashup tool for the IoT. We present some examples of how some of our 1800+ users are using FRED for IoT mashups, and some of the challenged we faced in implementing the FRED system. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The power transfer capability of existing transmission networks can be enhanced through the use of automated system protection schemes (SPS), which rapidly respond to disturbances on the network to keep the system's variables within operational bounds. However, reliance on such schemes may expose the network to large impacts-including blackouts-if the SPS does not respond as designed, so the deployment of SPS should balance risks and benefits. This paper formulates a risk-based cost-benefit framework that allows the operator to strike an optimal balance between constraint costs and risks of demand curtailment due to malfunctioning SPS. It is applied to a simple 4-bus power system inspired by the GB network, for which an exact optimisation problem can be formulated. A component-based dependability model is developed for the SPS to determine its failure modes and associated probabilities. The resulting cost-minimisation problem is solved for a range of operating conditions and SPS reliability levels. The results consistently show cost savings from the use of an SPS, even if it is highly unreliable, when a hedging strategy may be used. The optimal solution is highly sensitive to the problem parameters, but it is demonstrated that optimal operational strategies are associated with particular SPS outcomes. This finding may be used as empirical guidance to develop operational strategies for complex networks with unreliable SPS. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Wireless communication plays a critical role in determining the lifetime of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. Data aggregation approaches have been widely used to enhance the performance of IoT applications. Such approaches reduce the number of packets that are transmitted by combining multiple packets into one transmission unit, thereby minimising energy consumption, collisions and congestion. However, current data aggregation schemes restrict developers to a specific network structure or cannot handle multi-hop data aggregation. In this paper, we propose Hitch Hiker 2.0, a component binding model that provides support for multi-hop data aggregation. Hitch Hiker uses component meta-data to discover remote component bindings and to construct a multi-hop overlay network within the free payload space of existing traffic flows. Hitch Hiker 2.0 provides end-to-end routing of low-priority traffic while using only a small fraction of the energy of standard communication. This paper extends upon our previous work by incorporating new mechanisms for decentralised route discovery and providing additional application case studies and evaluation. We have developed a prototype implementation of Hitch Hiker for the LooCI component model. Our evaluation shows that Hitch Hiker consumes minimal resources and that using Hitch Hiker to deliver low-priority traffic reduces energy consumption by up to 32 %. © 2016, Ramachandran et al.},

abstract={Participatory Sensing, i.e. collaboratively taking sensor measurements with mobile devices in a Citizen Science fashion, has become increasingly popular. Because such scenarios often require a critical mass of users, applying gamification to different areas in order to increase user engagement has been proposed. However, existing attempts often default to the standard points, badges, and leaderboards and fail to recognize the potential of exploiting game design elements beyond creating user engagement. We propose not to think of Gamified Participatory Sensing when designing such systems, but rather of Sensified Gaming. To this end, this work presents a collection of design patterns and game mechanics that can be used to identify or design suitable games, into which participatory sensing tasks can be embedded. We identified four core tasks from participatory environmental sensing and sensor networks research, reviewed hundreds of design patterns and map each of the 63 selected patterns to the core tasks.},

abstract={Currently, factory automation systems need to cope with very different challenges, such as technological advances happening very fast, global and competitive market or product customization. These challenges lead to a new generation of automation systems based on the so-called Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) globally connected to form a flexible System of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SoCPPS). CPPSs require acquisition of production system data and smart data processing to extract information to improve the overall system performance. To achieve that it is needed to bridge the gap between the control systems and higher layers. This paper discusses an approach to use the IEC 61499 function block concept to exchange data between plant floor and higher layers using an industrial standard like OPC UA. The OPC UA server offers subscription mechanisms, making possible the integration of several resources residing at plant floor. As it runs on embedded devices, the proposal makes possible to acquire plant information at low cost, enabling at the same time, a component-based design for enterprise plant floor control with independence of the hardware platform used. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Smart city systems embrace major challenges associated with climate change, energy efficiency, mobility and future services by embedding the virtual space into a complex cyber-physical system. Those systems are constantly evolving and scaling up, involving a wide range of integration among users, devices, utilities, public services and also policies. Modelling such complex dynamic systems’ architectures has always been essential for the development and application of techniques/tools to support design and deployment of integration of new components, as well as for the analysis, verification, simulation and testing to ensure trustworthiness. This article reports on the definition and implementation of a scalable component-based architecture that supports a cooperative energy demand response (DR) system coordinating energy usage between neighbouring households. The proposed architecture, called refinement of Cyber-Physical Component Systems (rCPCS), which extends the refinement calculus for component and object system (rCOS) modelling method, is implemented using Eclipse Extensible Coordination Tools (ECT), i.e., Reo coordination language. With rCPCS implementation in Reo, we specify the communication, synchronisation and co-operation amongst the heterogeneous components of the system assuring, by design scalability and the interoperability, correctness of component cooperation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Nowadays embedded systems solve tasks in various domains (avionics, space industry, automotive, mobile devices, domestic appliances and so on). Moreover, these tasks are composed in various concepts: IoT, cyber-physical systems etc. Different classes of problems of the market and its needs make manufacturers of embedded systems to design heterogeneous many/multi core hardware platforms. Such platforms includes dozens of different cores: CPU, GPU, DSP, FPGA etc. Additionally, there is a high pressure of time to market. That makes them incredibly hard to program, especially in case when more and more domain experts are involved in the solution development process. For example, domain expert has knowledge in the area of image recognition or signal processing, but usually does not fully understand the specificity of programming for various kinds of hardware cores. In this article, we propose the complex technology and tools that allows involving domain experts in software development for embedded systems. The proposed technology has various aspects and abilities that can be used to build verifiable and portable software for a wide range of heterogeneous embedded platforms. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Model- and component-based design methods have resulted in dramatic increase of design productivity in several narrowly focused homogeneous domains, such as signal processing, control, and aspects of electronic design. A similar impact is expected on the design productivity of complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) if the challenges caused by heterogeneity of models and tools in design flows can be managed. This chapter examines the impact of heterogeneity on the composition and compositionality properties of models and tools and argues that new horizontal integration platforms for models, tools, and executions need to be developed to achieve progress. Using actual experience with developing an integrated design automation tool suite for vehicle power trains, OpenMETA, the chapter discusses the integration architecture and presents examples for a key component of the model and tool integration platforms, the OpenMETA Semantic Backplane. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={In today's highly technology-based world, wireless devices such as smartphones, are being utilized for solving daily problems and in making our daily lives more efficient. Although smartphones are sometimes to be blamed for vehicular accidents, they can also be used for helping to avoid accidents. In this paper we consider one such possible solution (called Project Drive), in which a smartphone based application is used to bridge the gap between negative driving detection and user motivation for safer driving behavior. Project Drive leverages a hosted web service to support the Android based application. Weather data is integrated with a modular negative driving detection component to create a point based system where positive driving is rewarded. Project Drive employs user motivation and retention strategies, such as gamification and social networking, as a means to promote safe driving. Users gain badges based on positive driving events that are seen by their contacts via the in-Application social feed. Points of interest, including positive driving event areas, are visible via an interactive map. A small scale prototype was developed and used for testing of the associated algorithms as well as the social aspects of the framework. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Industry 3.0 and 4.0 are catchphrases describing the increasing integration of software and physical computing into industrial facilities and processes. One of its consequences is the fact, that general and vocational education are faced with the challenge of integrating these aspects into the curriculum. In this paper such a teaching sequence is described and evaluated. It is based on a technical, low cost model of an industrial facility consisting of two components, each controlled by one Arduino. Both can be built and programmed independently using the graphical programming language abbozza!. The observations made during the conduction of the sequence in a German vocational grammar school are described, discussed and evaluated. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Serious Games have been established over recent years as a means of utilising gaming for applications other than entertainment. With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, a new direction for serious games arises, where data gathered from the physical environment can be utilised towards new novel applications. This literature survey uncovers existing topologies that can be applied for combining IoT with Serious Games. This paper presents findings from extensive research into IoT, Serious Games, Pervasive Games and Gamification, IoT topologies and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), to identify the requirements of a topology for Serious Games and IoT. By understanding the topological requirements for combining IoT and Serious Games, the development process is reduced, allowing for the advancement in the mentioned field. Three topologies are presented for combining IoT with Serious Games and a detailed topology for developing a Serious Game that monitors student attendance is presented. Also included, is an insight into the new paradigm of Smart Serious Games (SSGs). This paper will aid future research and development in SSGs determine effective network topologies. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Building automation is more and more deployed in buildings. Economic reasons in the terms of savings and higher efficiency are obvious and have ever been a motivation for building owners. Especially the current developments in the fields of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) take their roles in the further investigation in today's building automation systems. The integration of various kinds of technology with different origins requires the introduction of an abstraction which the service oriented architecture (SOA) principles provide. The introduction of a corresponding service landscape in complex and large dynamic systems like building automation systems (BAS) creates new challenges by thinking of dependability and fault tolerance. System maintainer can hardly handle faults and outages when the system consists of widely distributed services being installed through artifacts being dependent on others. This work presents a solution to these issues by introducing a technical management system supported by management rules, which are derived from the engineering and commissioning process of BAS. The technical management supports further enhancement of the automated operation including self-management,-repair, (re-)deployment, (re-)configuration, aspect independent monitoring and automatic failure notification to system maintainers. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Exercising is hard work, but, the motivation to exercise can be increased by applying aspects of gamification or contests. We present a system to bring these aspects into the application area of public spas by introducing sensor/actuator networks which are able to locate people even under water. Standard RFID tags in the shape of wristbands are used to localize the users at specific points in or around the pool. With knowledge of the exact position of the users a quantification is possible without explicit user interaction. We show that this gives the opportunity for competitions and games within the public pools. We present a system architecture, concepts for hardware and software, and a prototype implementation. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={This paper presents the Robot Operating System Model-driven development tool suite, (ROSMOD) an integrated development environment for rapid prototyping component-based software for the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware. ROSMOD is well suited for the design, development and deployment of large-scale distributed applications on embedded devices. We present the various features of ROSMOD including the modeling language, the graphical user interface, code generators, and deployment infrastructure. We demonstrate the utility of this tool with a real-world case study: an Autonomous Ground Support Equipment (AGSE) robot that was designed and prototyped using ROSMOD for the NASA Student Launch competition, 2014–2015. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Enabling early validation of extra functional properties can play an important role in the development process of reliable and safe cyber physical systems (CPS); this is particularly relevant in the automotive industry where the ever-increasing need to reduce electronic control unit (ECU) production development cost, enhance quality, and shorten the development cycle time is a crucial aspect. Building on the results of the recently ended CONCERTO project, CHESS pursues this objective by proposing a methodology and technology which fits into the welldefined AUTOSAR workflow.},

abstract={Context: Component-based software engineering is aimed at managing the complexity of large-scale software development by composing systems from reusable parts. To understand or validate the behavior of such a system, one needs to understand the components involved in combination with understanding how they are configured and composed. This becomes increasingly difficult when components are implemented in various programming languages, and composition is specified in external artifacts. Moreover, tooling that supports in-depth system-wide analysis of such heterogeneous systems is lacking. Objective: This paper contributes a method to analyze and visualize information flow in a component-based system at various levels of abstraction. These visualizations are designed to support the comprehension needs of both safety domain experts and software developers for, respectively, certification and evolution of safety-critical cyber-physical systems. Method: We build system-wide dependence graphs and use static program slicing to determine all possible end-to-end information flows through and across a system's components. We define a hierarchy of five abstractions over these information flows that reduce visual distraction and cognitive overload, while satisfying the users’ information needs. We improve on our earlier work to provide interconnected views that support both systematic, as well as opportunistic navigation scenarios. Results: We discuss the design and implementation of our approach and the resulting views in a prototype tool called FlowTracker. We summarize the results of a qualitative evaluation study, carried out via two rounds of interview, on the effectiveness and usability of these views. We discuss a number of improvements, such as more selective information presentations, that resulted from the evaluation. Conclusion: The evaluation shows that the proposed approach and views are useful for understanding and validating heterogeneous component-based systems, and address information needs that could earlier only be met by manual inspection of the source code. We discuss lessons learned and directions for future work. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Fog computing brings cloud close to end-users and data sources by enabling computation and storage at the edges of the network. An application can have some of its components running in a 'distant' cloud and interacting with the other components running in the fog, closer to end-users and data sources such as wireless sensors. Low latency is the main benefit. Applications spanning cloud and fog, such as Internet of Things (IoT) applications, are still provisioned manually nowadays. This paper proposes an architecture for a Platform as-a-Service (PaaS) to automate applications provisioning in a hybrid cloud/fog environment. Cloud Foundry is used as the basis for its implementation. As a use case, the proposed PaaS was employed to provision a simple component-based IoT application that detects fire and dispatches robots to fight the fire. A prototype is built and measurements are made. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT), which has had an unprecedented effect in the manufacturing industry, is now becoming increasingly popular in everyday life. Even with the rising interest in IoT among developers, there is no simple way for them to prototype and realize their ideas. As of today, developing an IoT project requires cross domain knowledge of hardware, embedded systems, communication protocols, and cloud and web technologies. We propose and implement the Zygote framework, a browser-based tool to lower the entry barrier and enable rapid prototyping and building of IoT projects. Zygote reduces the time and effort required to do so by providing a visual interface to configure, control and deploy an IoT application. It also exposes a REST API for programmatic control as well as a dashboard for quick data visualization. With its modular architecture, it supports the creation of custom plugins as required by the developer. The Zygote framework enables users to build IoT prototypes in minutes and with virtually zero lines of code. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Microsoft released its Robotics Developer Studio (MSRDS) and Visual Programming Language (VPL) in 2006. Microsoft VPL is service-oriented, uses workflow-based visual programming, and has strong support for parallel computing. It is a milestone and flagship in software engineering and in computer science education. Many universities and high schools have adopted VPL as a tool for teaching computing and engineering concepts and for programming robots. Unfortunately, as part of Microsoft's restructuring plan, the robotics division of Microsoft Research was suspended on September 22, 2014, leaving the Microsoft VPL community without updates and support. Arizona State University (ASU) is among the schools that adopted VPL since its first release in 2006. We started to find a solution to our VPL-based curriculum in 2014. This paper presents our research and development of a new visual programming language and its development environment: ASU VIPLE (Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Language Environment). ASU VIPLE extends the discontinued Microsoft VPL to sustain our curriculum and to help the community with their VPL projects. ASU VIPLE supports LEGO EV3 and all IoT devices based on an open architecture. ASU VIPLE integrates engineering design process, workflow, fundamental programming concepts, control flow, parallel computing, event-driven programming seamlessly into the curriculum. It has been pilot tested at Arizona State University in summer 2015 and in spring 2016, as well as in several other universities. ASU VIPLE software and documents can be freely downloaded at: http://venus.eas.asu.edu/WSRepository/VIPLE/. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Event-driven programming is a popular methodology for the development of resource-constrained embedded systems. While it is a natural abstraction for applications that interface with the physical world, the disadvantage is that the control flow of a program is hidden in the maze of event handlers and call-back functions. TinyOS is a representative event-driven operating system, designed for wireless sensor networks, featuring a component-based architecture that promotes code reuse. In this paper, we present a web-based model-driven graphical design environment for TinyOS that visualizes the component hierarchy of an application, and captures its event-based scheduling mechanism. In contrast with existing visual environments, our representation explicitly captures the control flow of the application through events and commands, which makes it easier to understand the program logic than studying the source code. The design environment supports two-way code generation: mapping the visual representation to TinyOS source code, as well as building visual models from existing sources. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the central research challenges in the Internet of Things and Ubiquitous Computing domains is how users can be enabled to 'program' their personal and industrial smart environments by combining services that are provided by devices around them. We present a service composition system that enables the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-driven approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible applications of the presented system include the management of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Since the introduction of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) researchers have started exploring the design space of Medical Capsule Robots (MCRs): embedded micro-systems that can operate autonomously within the human body and can diagnose, prevent, monitor, and cure diseases. Although the research in the area of MCRs is an active topic and has grown exponentially, current devices provide only limited functionalities because their design process is expensive and time consuming. To open this research field to a wider community and, at the same time, create better designs through advanced tool support, in our previous works we presented a design environment for the rapid development of MCRs. In this paper, this environment was adopted to design a Drug Delivery Capsule (DDC) based on a coil-magnet-piston mechanism. The force of the coil acting on the magnetic piston and the drug release profile were modeled and assessed on bench-top with a maximum relative error below 5%. Then, in vivo trials were performed to validate the DDC functionality with a scheduled drug release profile for a 5 h and 24 min procedure. The resulting design environment template is available open source for further development of drug delivery applications as well as to serve as guideline in prototyping novel MCRs addressing other clinical needs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={By focussing on Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), this paper investigates how component-based principles and practices are used and support the activity of architecting CPS. For doing so, by running a systematic process, we selected 49 primary studies from the most important publishers search engines. Those papers have been analyzed and their contents classified according to the Classification Framework for Component Models proposed in our previous work. The results show that the main concerns handled by CPS component models are those of integration, performance, and maintainability. The instruments to satisfy those concerns, while architecting CPS, are ad-hoc software/system architecture, model-based approaches, architectural and component languages, and design. The IEC 61499 standard with its functions block is remarkably used to drive the work on six papers. Java is the most frequently used programming language used for implementing the components. Components are deployed mostly at compile time. Interfaces are almost equally distributed into port-based and operation-based. Overall, the results show a transition of technologies and approaches used in Embedded Systems to CPS, but still lacking methods for integrated architecting, in particular in incremental development. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The component-based software architecture of a cyber-physical system (CPS) is often subject to structural reconfigurations in response to changing environmental conditions. When introducing reconfigurations to CPS, it is mandatory to ensure that the execution of a reconfiguration does not compromise the safety of the system, e.g., by causing a violation of hard real-time constraints. Existing approaches for ensuring safe reconfiguration do not consider such hard realtime constraints or the interaction of a CPS with its physical environment. Thus, they can not detect all relevant unsafe situations. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that is based on a design-time specification of conditions for unsafe states combined with a runtime evaluation of these conditions. This enables to detect all relevant unsafe states with respect to a requested reconfiguration at runtime. We illustrate our approach based on a smart railway system. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) embeds sensors, actuators and computation into everyday 'things' such as lights and thermostats. These things form low-power wireless networks connecting to the Internet via IPv6 for monitoring and control. Such IoT systems are increasingly subject to runtime reconfiguration, wherein new hardware and software may be installed dynamically to accommodate changing application objectives. Supporting runtime reconfiguration, while maintaining reliability and low-power operation requires cross-layer optimisation of network resources. This paper introduces Dawn, a network optimisation approach for component-based systems that automatically extracts and enforces bandwidth requirements from component compositions. Dawn allows application developers to build extremely flexible and yet dependable IoT networks. We implemented a prototype of Dawn for a 50-node testbed composed of state-of-the-art embedded IoT devices. Our evaluation shows that Dawn preserves 100% end-to-end reliability in the face of network reconfiguration, while extending battery lifetime three-fold compared to a one-size-fits-all network configuration with minimal memory and performance overhead. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Networked embedded objects augmented with smart applications have already started encompassing many aspects of human life. More often these objects are driven by limited power sources and hence estimation of remaining energy in these objects at run time becomes important. Also power profiling provides a rough idea on how long the intended applications will run on the network given the battery-life specification. The proposed component based architecture use a power estimation module for dynamic power profiling. The code for power estimation could be disseminated either through direct burning or over-the-air programming in each objects of the network. The scheme has been implemented and tested on a wireless sensor network set-up where smart objects considered are TelosB nodes running on Contiki operating system. The experiment conducted, the results and observations are presented. © 2015 IEEE.},

This can raise productivity and stability as it makes it easy to intuitively understand the flow of a function or program that modules and parts have. It can even describe disposal procedures for data or algorithms.

abstract={Recently, it has become common for designers to deal with complex and large-scale ubicomp or IoT spaces. Designers without technical implementation skills have difficulties in prototyping such spaces, especially in the early phases of design. We present miniStudio, a designers' tool for prototyping ubicomp space with proxemic interactions. It is built on designers' existing software and modeling materials (Photoshop, Lego, and paper). Interactions can be defined in Photoshop based on five spatial relations: location, distance, motion, orientation, and custom. Projection-based augmented reality was applied to miniatures in order to enable tangible interactions and dynamic representations. Hidden marker stickers and a camera-projector system enable the unobtrusive integration of digital images on the physical miniature. Through the user study with 12 designers and researchers in the ubicomp field, we found that miniStudio supported rapid prototyping of large and complex ideas with multiple connected components. Based on the tool development and the study, we discuss the implications for prototyping ubicomp environments in the early phase of the design. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems typically involve large numbers of mobile autonomous devices that closely interact with each other and their environment. Standard design and development techniques often fail to effectively manage the complexity and dynamics of such systems. As a result, there is a strong need for new programing models and abstractions. Towards this, component-based design methods are a promising solution. However, existing such approaches either do not accurately model transitory interactions between components - which are typical of cyber-physical systems - or do not provide guarantees for real-time behavior which is essential in safety-critical applications. To overcome this problem, we present a component-based design technique based on DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components). The DEECo framework allows modeling large-scale dynamic systems by a set of interacting components and, in contrast to approaches from the literature, it provides mechanisms to describe transitory interactions between them. To allow reasoning about timing behavior at the component-description level, we characterize DEECo's closed-loop delay in the worst case, i.e., the maximum time needed to react to a change in the environment. Based on this, we incorporate real-time analysis into DEECo's design flow. This further allows us to analyze the system's robustness under unreliable communication and to design decentralized safety-preserving mechanisms. To illustrate the simplicity and usefulness of our approach, we present a case study consisting of an intelligent crossroad system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Much has been published about potential benefits of the adoption of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in manufacturing industry. However, less has been said about how such automation systems might be effectively configured and supported through their lifecycles and how application modeling, visualization, and reuse of such systems might be best achieved. It is vitally important to be able to incorporate support for engineering best practice while at the same time exploiting the potential that CPS has to offer in an automation systems setting. This paper considers the industrial context for the engineering of CPS. It reviews engineering approaches that have been proposed or adopted to date including Industry 4.0 and provides examples of engineering methods and tools that are currently available. The paper then focuses on the CPS engineering toolset being developed by the Automation Systems Group (ASG) in the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K. and explains via an industrial case study how such a component-based engineering toolset can support an integrated approach to the virtual and physical engineering of automation systems through their lifecycle via a method that enables multiple vendors' equipment to be effectively integrated and provides support for the specification, validation, and use of such systems across the supply chain, e.g., between end users and system integrators. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The proximity between physical and cyber worlds is permitting the appearance of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), formed by users and devices (physical) interacting with services, components and applications (cyber). In CPS, where unpredictability is an important challenge, two characteristics must be present in the developed systems: i) low coupling among interacting modules and ii) self-adaptive capabilities. In that direction, this paper describes an uncoupled sensor and actuator component-based infrastructure for self adaptive CPS. Its main contribution is two-fold: i) a lightweight and interoperable mechanism to specify and manage sensors and actuators, built on top of an ii) uncoupled communication and coordination mechanism for cyberphysical entities. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Although wireless sensor networks are widely used in recent years, it remains a big security risk in the transmission of information and energy consumption of the nodes. By summarizing the existing wireless sensor networks attack measures, this paper proposes a way to attack wireless sensor networks by wireless injection, at different times fake nodes is disguised as acquisition nodes and transmission nodes, passing a lot of fake information to other nodes, and it results in the excessive energy consumption of the transmission nodes. In the component-based development Tiny OS system, we use the Micaz nodes to carry out the attack experiments and performance evaluation. Experiment results show that this method achieves the results. It is that the transmission delay will be significantly with more attack nodes and longer attack period, and it also verifies the insufficient performance of wireless sensor networks nodes. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Sensing/actuating ingredients are software running on smart devices which are widely deployed in physical spaces and integrated into our daily life. An Internet of Things (IoT) application can be composed of multiple sets of sensing/actuating ingredients and each ingredient can satisfy specific requirement of users by processing specific physical data collected from physical world or committing an action. However, users' requirements for functionalities of ingredients and overall goals of IoT applications are diverse and may change. The application diversity leads to a rise in complexity as well as the cost of developing and maintaining the system software of an IoT application. In this work, we aim to reduce the design complexity and development cost of IoT application software. To achieve this goal, we use the software architecture PMDA which was proposed in our previous work. Here, we present a component-based formal methodology, namely FMDA, to transform the components of PMDA into sets of software modules as sensing/actuating functionality required. At the same time, we propose a connection mechanism, namely FM-CA, which can match and establish the interconnection between any two sensing/actuating ingredients as required. The behavior of FMDA and FMCA have been investigated. The evaluation results show that FMCA is more effective in reducing the cost if the requirements changing frequently or the failure probability of matching the required sensing/actuating ingredients is small. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Routing in sensor networks with unpredictable network connections and node failures is challenging due to the lack of knowledge about network dynamics in decision making. We present a self-adaptive middleware for efficient routing in distributed sensor network. At the heart of the proposed approach is the design of a policy-driven language to control the relocation of software components between sensor nodes. Accordingly, various changes in sensor networks can be dynamically adapted. Based on such a middleware, we provide a few approaches in building a practical routing protocol. For instance, nodes can adaptively switch their routing strategies according to the network stability or migrate some tasks to other idle nodes to prevent from node failures. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) provide sophisticated functionality and are controlled by networked electronic control units (ECUs). Nowadays, software engineers use component-based development approaches to develop their software. Moreover, software components have to be allocated to an ECU to be executed. Engineers have to cope with topology-, software-, and timing-dependencies and memory-, scheduling-, and routing-constraints. Currently, engineers use linear programs to specify allocation constraints and to derive a feasible allocation automatically. However, encoding the allocation problem as a linear program is a complex and error-prone task. This paper contributes a model-driven, OCL-based allocation engineering approach for reducing the engineering effort and to avoid failures. We validate our approach with an automotive case study modeled with MechatronicUML. Our validation shows that we can specify allocation constraints with less engineering effort and are able to derive feasible allocations automatically. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of Internet of Things, fueled by cloud computing and big data processing from upper level, and by ubiquitous sensory and actuator devices from the lower level, has taken a sharp turn towards integrating the entire information, computing, communication, and control systems. This special issue selected seven papers from the 2015 IEEE twelfth International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ISADS). These papers cover the latest research on IoT and ADS based system science and system engineering methods; the wearable sensor network development and applications; and data analysis for security and reliability in IoT and ADS applications. As an addition to these selected topics, this guest editorial paper also adds IoT education and dissemination aspects to this special issue. As the IoT research and applications expand explosively into all the domains, schools and universities must prepare students to understand and to be able to program the IoT devices. This paper presents a visual programming environment that allows students without programming background to learn the key concepts of computing and IoT devices, and to program IoT devices into different application systems. © 2016},

abstract={Multi-module Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), such as satellite clusters, swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and fleets of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) provide a CPS cluster-asa- service for CPS applications. The distributed and remote nature of these systems often necessitates the use of Deployment and Configuration (D&C) services to manage the lifecycle of these applications. Fluctuating resources, volatile cluster membership and changing environmental conditions necessitate resilience. Thus, the D&C infrastructure does not only have to undertake basic management actions, such as activation of new applications and deactivation of existing applications, but also has to autonomously reconfigure existing applications to mitigate failures including D&C infrastructure failures. This paper describes the design and architectural considerations to realize such a D&C infrastructure for component-based distributed systems. Experimental results demonstrating the autonomous resilience capabilities are presented. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Sensor web systems, cyber-physical systems, and the so-called Internet of Things are concepts that share a set of common characteristics. The nature of such systems is highly dynamic and very heterogeneous and issues such as interoperability, energy consumption, or resource management must be properly managed to ensure the operation of the applications within the required quality of service level. In this context, base technologies such as component based software engineering or Service Oriented Architecture can play a central role. Model driven development and middleware technologies also aid in the design, development, and operation of such systems. This paper presents a middleware solution that provides runtime support for the complete lifecycle management of a system consisting of several concurrent applications running over a set of distributed infrastructure nodes. The middleware builds up on top of a general purpose component model and is driven by a quality of service aware self-configuration algorithm that provides stateful reconfiguration capabilities in face of both internal (application triggered) and external (application unaware) reconfiguration events. The platform has been deployed over an automated warehouse supervision system that serves as a case study. © 2016 Aitor Agirre et al.},

abstract={In the last decade, the amount of cyber-attacks targeting industrial facilities with specialized knowledge, tools and malware increased dramatically. The wide variety of industrial IT-systems and various required expertise for cyber-physical attack modeling is currently a challenge for interdisciplinary research. To address the variety of systems and get a point of reference, we merged architecture descriptions from available resources. Based on this reference architecture, we introduce attack scopes and provide exemplary attack scenarios per scope. As modeling strategy for the introduced scopes and to realize abstracted representations of particular industrial facility architectures, a component-based modeling approach is proposed. The main contribution of the presented work is a first generic attack modeling technique facilitating the required interdisciplinary collaboration in this important field of research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={This paper explores how gamification can provide the platform for integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) together with the emergent Internet of Things (IoT). The goal of the research is to foster the creation of a testable and persistent virtual building via gaming technology that combines both BIM and IoT. The author discusses the features of each subject area in brief, and points towards the advantages and challenges of integration via gaming technology. Hospitals are the specific architectural typology discussed in the paper, as hospitals have particular properties which make them good candidates for study. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2016.},

abstract={The notion of software engineering implies that software design and production should be based on the types of theoretical foundations and practical disciplines that are established in the traditional branches of engineering. The goal is to make development of complex software systems more predictable and the systems developed more trustworthy - safe, secure and dependable. A number of theories have been well developed in the past half a century, including Abstract Data Types, Hoare Logic, Process Calculi, and I/O automata, and those alike. Based on them, techniques and tools have been developed for software specification, refinement and verification. However, the theoretically sound techniques and tools have not been seamlessly integrated in practical software development, and their impact upon commonly-used software systems is still far from convincing to software engineering practitioners. This is clearly reflected by the challenges of their applications in engineering large-scale systems, including Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), Networks of Things and Cloud-Based Systems, that have multi-dimensional complexities. Indeed, students are not often shown how the theories, and their underpinned techniques and tools, can better inform the software engineering they are traditionally taught. The purpose of this course to demonstrate such an effort. We present a model-driven design framework for component-based and object-oriented software systems. We identify a set of UML notations and textual descriptions for representing different abstractions of software artefacts produced in different development stages. These abstractions, their relations and manipulations all have formalisations in the rCOS formal method of component and object systems. The aim is to allow the advantage of using precise models for development better appreciated. We organise the lecture notes into three chapters, each having a title page but all the references to literature are given at the end of Part III. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Widespread use of connected smart devices that are equipped with various built-in sensors has introduced the mobile crowdsensing concept to the IoT-driven information and communication applications. Mobile crowdsensing requires implicit collaboration between the crowdsourcer/recruiter platforms and users. Additionally, users need to be incentivized by the crowdsensing platform because each party aims to maximize their utility. Due to the participatory nature of data collection, trustworthiness and truthfulness pose a grand challenge in crowdsensing systems in the presence of malicious users, who either aim to manipulate sensed data or collaborate unfaithfully with the motivation of maximizing their income. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach for trustworthiness-driven user recruitment in mobile crowdsensing systems that consists of three phases: i) user recruitment, ii) collaborative decision making on trust scores, and iii) badge rewarding. Our proposed framework incentivizes the users through a sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) and gamification techniques. Through simulations, we show that the platform and user utilities, defined in terms of costs and revenues, can be improved respectively by up to the order of 50% and of at least 15% when compared to fully-distributed and user-centric trustworthy crowdsensing. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent years have seen a rapid deployment across the world of an Internet of Things (IoT) solution referred to as smart meters, with Europe expected to reach 80% of households by 2020. Many researchers have been focusing on technical aspects of smart meters neglecting the end consumer which is resulting in deployment failures such as in the Netherlands. On the other hand consumers are resisting governments on their wide rollouts and still questioning the benefits of smart meters due to issues mainly on privacy and security. To address this void, this paper presents a new approach to increase user engagement in using smart meter systems. We applied gamification in a smart meter feedback system as the second cycle of a design science research project. Applying gamification in that context is expected to change the user behavior towards smart meters and electricity consumption. We follow three main aspects in order to gamify smart meter feedback systems as follows: challenges and clear goals, social interactions and finally autonomy and feedbacks. We contribute to both practice and research by gamifying a smart meter provider's system in Germany. As a result we present three main aspects to follow in order to gamify a smart meter feedback system and open future research opportunities in changing user behavior and studying user engagement towards smart meters.},

abstract={Self-adaptive systems are modern applications in which the running software system should be able to react on its own, by dynamically adapting its behavior, for sustaining a required set of qualities of service, and dynamic changes in the context or in user requirements. They are typically involved in Future Internet development such as the Internet of Things where interoperability, flexibility, and adaptability are key requirements. Convergence of contents, services, things and networks seems to be the cornerstone to fullfil these requirements. We propose a reflective approach to provide a common abstraction for automating the deployment of component based applications in the Internet of Things environment. The proposed framework allows the design of heterogeneous, distributed, and adaptive applications built on the component based software engineering paradigm. The framework considers a metamodel instantiated in a Rest middleware properly modified for allowing different implementations by using reflective design patterns. We are currently working to refine the framework metamodel and to validate it in several implementation domains. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={Along with the boom of Mobile services and the thriving Model Driven Architecture (MDA), we must consider the growing significance and utility of modeling in the development of software and solutions. The main advantages of MDA are the ability to transform one PIM into several PSMs, one for each platform or technology in which the final system will be deployed, and the automatic code generation that implements the system for those platforms from the corresponding PSMs. Service-oriented architectures (SOA) are also touted as the key to business agility, especially when combined with a model-driven approach. Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) is a well-developed concept that fits well with SOA, but until now it has been a specialized technique that is beyond practical application scope of most enterprises. Model driven and Domain engineering is the foundation for emerging "product line" software development approaches and affects the maintainability, understandability, usability, and reusability characteristics of family of similar systems. However, the existing domain engineering methods do not elicit information necessary for the Component-based Software Development process, such as, selecting and configuring appropriate components. In this paper, we suggest a method that systematically defines, analyzes and designs a crop monitoring frameworks domain to enhance reusability effectively in Model Driven Engineering and Component-based Software Development. For this, we extract information objectively that can be reused in a crop monitoring domain from the requirement analysis phase. We sustain and refine crop monitoring information, and match them to artifacts of each phase in domain engineering. Through this method, reusable domain components and malleable domain architecture can be produced. In addition, we show the practical applicability and features of our approach via a new clouding and IOT technology. © 2016 SERSC.},

abstract={In this paper we examine the development of IoT applications from the perspective of the Fog Computing paradigm, where computing infrastructure at the network edge in devices and gateways is leverage for efficiency and timeliness. Due to the intrinsic nature of the IoT: heterogeneous devices/resources, a tightly coupled perception-action cycle and widely distributed devices and processing, application development in the Fog can be challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a Distributed Dataflow (DDF) programming model for the IoT that utilises computing infrastructures across the Fog and the Cloud. We evaluate our proposal by implementing a DDF framework based on Node-RED (Distributed Node-RED or D-NR), a visual programming tool that uses a flow-based model for building IoT applications. Via demonstrations, we show that our approach eases the development process and can be used to build a variety of IoT applications that work efficiently in the Fog. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper introduces the concept of tomography, a mechanism to lower management overhead for component-based IoT applications. Previous research has shown the advantages of component-based software engineering, wherein applications are built and reconfigured at runtime through the composition of components. While this approach promotes code-reuse and dynamic reconfiguration, the introspection and reconfiguration of distributed applications is cumbersome and inefficient. Tomography addresses this problem by reimagining the visitor design pattern for distributed component based compositions. We evaluate the performance of this approach in a case-study of discovering/introspecting and reconfiguring a real-world IoT application. We show that in comparison to classic management operations, tomography reduces both the number of explicit queries and the volume of network messages. This significantly reduces management effort and energy consumption. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) connects sensors, actuators and autonomous objects interacting with each other. These devices are represented by web services. Web services composition often involves conflicts between systems having access to shared devices. In our component-based middleware, our solution allows managing access to shared devices, by generating specific constraint components which guarantee the respect of some predefined composition and adaptation constraints. IoT environments are dynamic; our solution ensures adaptation to its changes by using new generated constraint components and inhibitors to deal with the appearance and disappearance of devices/applications. The main contribution in this work is the definition of a new language DCL (Description Constraint Language) that helps to generate our constraint components by describing generic constraints that must be verified on accesses to shared devices. The whole approach and its associated tools rely on the synchronous paradigm, since it has a wellestablished formal foundation allowing automatic proofs, and interface with most model-checkers. We can then prove and guarantee a safe composition at runtime for our IoT applications. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new approach for modelling a Congestion Detection mechanism on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) using the Petri Net (PN) language. Even though PNs are powerful for modelling concurrent systems, they suffer from a high computational cost when verifying properties on the modelled system. We suggest a component-based abstraction to tackle this problem. First, a PN system can be considered as a set of connected components. For instance, a WSN includes a Sensor component and a Channel component. When performing verification on a model, we can abstract the insignificant components and only focus on the remaining ones. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is practically feasible when tested with various kinds of congestion occurring on different PN modelling WSNs. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={We address the problem how high-fidelity verification results about the hybrid systems dynamics of cyber-physical flow systems can be provided at the scale of large (traffic) networks without prohibitive analytic cost. We propose the use of contracts for traffic flow components concisely capturing the conditions for a safe operation in the context of a traffic network. This reduces the analysis of flows in the full traffic network to simple arithmetic checks of the local compatibility of the traffic component contracts, while retaining higher-fidelity correctness guarantees of the global hybrid systems models that inherits from correct contracts of the hybrid system components. We evaluate our approach in a case study of a modular traffic network and a prototypical implementation in a model-based analysis and design tool for traffic flow networks. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={A current challenge of mobile computing is the need to an infrastructure that, in development-time, allows applications can dinamically adapt itself to the scenario. One of approaches that allows this infrastructure is the component-based middleware platforms use. An example of middleware is LoCCAM, intended for devices with Android operating system. This paper presents the LoCCAM evolution. Now, LoCCAM perform dinamically deploy of new components according to changes in the environment. We aim to make LoCCAM an infrastructure capable of providing support for mobile multimedia systems in IoT scenario. Dynamic deployment also enables applications to adapt dynamically to different versions of Android OS. We had create an application that uses mobile augmented reality based contextaware concepts as case study. We tested this application in two smartphones with different Android versions and one smartwatch with Android Wear. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Identifying drawbacks or insufficiencies in terms of safety is important also in early development stages of safety critical systems. In industry, development artefacts such as components or units, are often reused from existing artefacts to save time and costs. When development artefacts are reused, their existing safety analysis models are an important input for an early safety assessment for the new system, since they already provide a valid model. Component fault trees support such reuse strategies by a compositional horizontal approach. But current development strategies do not only divide systems horizontally, e.g., By encapsulating different functionality into separate components and hierarchies of components, but also vertically, e.g. Into software and hardware architecture layers. Current safety analysis methodologies, such as component fault trees, do not support such vertical layers. Therefore, we present here a methodology that is able to divide safety analysis models into different layers of a systems architecture. We use so called Architecture Layer Failure Dependencies to enable component fault trees on different layers of an architecture. These dependencies are then used to generate safety evidence for the entire system and over all different architecture layers. A case study applies the approach to hardware and software layers. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Since the late 90s the idea of mass customization in industry is present. The main goal is to handle the consumer demand for customized products. Recent developments in research, engineering and technology enable industries to move from profitable linear assembly lines to profitable nonlinear, dynamic assembly lines to satisfy such a demand. Industry 4.0, a German governmental initiative, encourages industries to use interconnected Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to create context-sensitive and decentralized factory environments. CPSs in combination with tracking technologies and a component based assembly line can create a factory environment that allows customers to change their requirements during assemblytime. Such change is typically not considered in the domain of manufacturing. In modern software engineering projects, agile techniques allow customer change during the entire development phase. Such change results in customer oriented, customized software products. In this paper we describe the development of an Agile Factory prototype. The developed Agile Factory prototype transfers agile software engineering techniques to the domain of manufacturing. It explores the impact and feasibility of customer changes during assembly-time using a commercially available software framework. The assembly line of the Agile Factory is component based, using trackable mobile worktables in combination with stationary workstations. Therefore, each product with its associated request is trackable during assembly-time which enables us to implement a customer feedback loop. The feedback loop allows change requests during assembly-time. Without the integration of such tracking techniques a customer feedback loop is very difficult up to impossible to implement. We created a Cyber-Physical Human System (CPHS) using smart factory-hardware in combination with an accepted manufacturing software framework. We bridge the virtual and physical world enabling the customer and the factory worker to communicate with actual physical objects. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={With the development of the Internet of things(IoT), many various IoT applications continue to emerge. How to evaluate the approbate degree of users on IoT applications is an important problem in IoT research. To address this problem, this paper presents an IoT quality of experience(QoE) evaluation method based on multiple linear regression analysis. Firstly, this paper analyzes the type of IoT applications, determines the quality of service(QoS) parameters of QoE and collects the sample data. Then, it gets the principal components by principal component analysis, associates QoE to the principal components based on multiple regression analysis and builds the regression equation between QoE and principal components. Finally, it gets the functional model between QoE and QoS parameters on the basis of the regression equation. Experimental results show that this evaluation method can reduce the complexity of QoE evaluation and quantify functional relation between QoE and QoS parameters. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Publish/subscribe communication is a common architectural design pattern in component-based software systems used in many of today's cyber-physical systems to exchange in-formation between distributed software components. These systems typically deal with an increased number of data transfers, with a risk of lacking resources. Our recent do-main analysis for a lane-following algorithm of a self-driving miniature car unveiled that the actual \information incre-ment" between two subsequently sent packets is often small. Such scenario enables possibilities for a more effcient data exchange by avoiding redundant and/or unnecessary infor-mation transfer. In this paper, we propose and evaluate our concept for \self-Adaptive data marshalling" that trans-parently adapts data types in messages to be exchanged by analyzing the actual information increment. The approach could reduce the bandwidth usage by more than 50% in com-parison to the current approach, and by approximately 33% compared to the use of the general-purpose compression li-brary zlib. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Time synchronization is essential for node localization, target tracking, data fusion, and various other Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications. To improve the estimation accuracy of continuous clock offset and skew of mobile nodes in WSNs, we propose a novel time synchronization algorithm, the Rao-Blackwellised (RB) particle filter time synchronization algorithm based on the Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model. In a state-space equation with a linear substructure, state variables are divided into linear and non-linear variables by the RB particle filter algorithm. These two variables can be estimated using Kalman filter and particle filter, respectively, which improves the computational efficiency more so than if only the particle filter was used. In addition, the DPM model is used to describe the distribution of non-deterministic delays and to automatically adjust the number of Gaussian mixture model components based on the observational data. This improves the estimation accuracy of clock offset and skew, which allows achieving the time synchronization. The time synchronization performance of this algorithm is also validated by computer simulations and experimental measurements. The results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher time synchronization precision than traditional time synchronization algorithms. © 2015, by the authors.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems introduce new requirements for modelling and executing autonomous processes. Current workflow languages are not able to completely fulfil these requirements, as they lack expressiveness and flexibility. In this paper, we present an object-oriented workflow language for formalizing processes within heterogeneous and dynamic environments. Its component-based meta-model enables the hierarchical composition of processes and process variants. Domain-specific typing and polymorphism leverage the flexibility of processes by enabling the dynamic selection of process components. We present a modelling environment and a distributed execution engine for the meta-model. In addition, we discuss the use of semantic technologies for smart workflows. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We are witnessing a new revolution in computing and communication involving symbiotic networks of people (social networks), intelligent devices, smart mobile computing, and communication devices that will form cyber-physical social systems. The emergence of intelligent devices with monitoring, sensing, and actuation capabilities referred to as Internet of Things and social networks have increased the popularity of novel social applications such as crowdsourcing and crowdsensing. The upsurge of such applications has fostered the need for scalable cost-efficient platforms that can enable distributed data analytics. In this paper, we propose CARDAP, a scalable, energy-efficient, generic and extensible component-based distributed data analytics platform for mobile crowdsensing (MCS) applications. CARDAP incorporates on-the-move activity recognition and a number of energy efficient data delivery strategies using real-time mobile data stream mining. We propose and develop theoretical cost models for typical crowdsensing application scenarios. Experimental evaluations of CARDAP using a proof-of-concept MCS scenario validate the theoretical cost model estimates and demonstrate the platform's ability to deliver significant benefits in energy, resource, and query processing efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent advances in embedded devices capabilities and wireless networks paved the way for creating ubiquitous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) grafted with self-configuring and self-adaptive capabilities. As these systems need to strike a balance between dependability, open-endedness and adaptability, and operate in dynamic and opportunistic environments, their design and development is particularly challenging. We take an architecture-based approach to this problem and advocate the use of component-based abstractions and related machinery to engineer self-adaptive CPS. Our approach is structured around DEECo - a component framework that introduces the concept of component ensembles to deal with the dynamicity of CPS at the middleware level. DEECo provides the architecture abstractions of autonomous components and component ensembles on top of which different adaptation techniques can be deployed. This makes DEECo a vehicle for seamless experiments with self-adaptive systems where the physical distribution and mobility of nodes, and the limited data availability play an important role. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={With the goal of relieving the Internet of things (IoT)application designers of the complexities and heterogeneity of wireless sensory networks (WSNs), devices, communication media, protocols and operating systems, the development of higher level domain specific language has been undertaken. The result is DSL-4-IoT Editor-Designer, which is based on high level visual programming language, established on the class of visual domain specific modeling languages (VDSMLs). DSL-4-IoT is using formal presentations and abstract syntax in a metamodel. The visual front-end of the Editor has been developed in JavaScript language. The runtime execution of generated IoT application configuration files is done by the open source project 'OpenHAB' runtime engine. In order to demonstrate the viability and usability of the developed DSL-4-IoT visual model based language, an experimental IoT testbed including 15 heterogeneous wireless sensory devices spanning two application domain (smart home and remote patient monitoring), has been designed and deployed. © 2015 MIPRO.},

abstract={This chapter presents a methodology based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) and interoperability to convert existing buildings, even historical, into smart buildings. The chapter starts describing the main concepts of BIM and interoperability in the Architecture, Engineer and Construction (AEC) industry with special attention on integrating information from heterogeneous devices deployed in the building. Then, it details the SEEMPubS (Smart Energy Efficient Middleware for Public Buildings) middleware, which consists on three layers: (i) Integration Layer, (ii) Middleware Layer, and (iii) Application Layer. The validation of the most significant results is presented using both gamification and technical approaches involving different end-users. Finally, Apps for data management are introduced with a Community Portal and an Android Application for real-time data visualization. Future works introduce the integration of smart building into smart district context. © 2015, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Developing correct, effcient, and maintainable real-Time con-Trol software for cyber-physical systems is a notoriously dif-fficult interdisciplinary challenge. Ever more complex con-Trol algorithms and the advent of multi-core hardware in embedded systems have made this challenge even harder. Component-based software development promises to help re-duce the complexity and to increase the timing predictability for time-critical software. This paper presents FASA, a component-based approach for scalable real-Time systems. This approach offers a plat-form-independent development method with a high degree of predictability, supports multi-core systems by design, and simplifes maintenance. Two case studies validate FASA: an application handling a magnetic levitation device and an example of scalability. Copyright © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Modern cyber-physical systems interact closely with contin-uous physical processes like kinematic movement. Software component frameworks do not provide an explicit way to represent or reason about these processes. Meanwhile, hy-brid program models have been successful in proving crit-ical properties of discrete-continuous systems. These pro-grams deal with diverse aspects of a cyber-physical sys-Tem such as controller decisions, component communication protocols, and mechanical dynamics, requiring several pro-grams to address the variation. However, currently these aspects are often intertwined in mostly monolithic hybrid programs, which are difficult to understand, change, and or-ganize. These issues can be addressed by component-based engineering, making hybrid modeling more practical. This paper lays the foundation for using architectural models to provide component-based benefits to developing hybrid pro-grams. We build formal architectural abstractions of hy-brid programs and formulas, enabling analysis of hybrid pro-grams at the component level, reusing parts of hybrid pro-grams, and automatic transformation from views into hybrid programs and formulas. Our approach is evaluated in the context of a robotic collision avoidance case study. Copyright © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The emerging area of (smart) Cyber Physical Systems (sCPS) triggers demand for new methods of design, development, and deployment of architecturally dynamic distributed systems. Current approaches (e.g. Component-Based Software Engineering and Agent-Based Development) become insufficient since they fail in addressing challenges specific to sCPS such as mobility, heterogeneous and unreliable deployment infrastructure, and architectural dynamicity. The strong dependence on the underlying communication infrastructure, often combining ad-hoc established links typical for wireless connectivity with more reliable connections of infrastructural networks, requires a novel method to optimize system deployment. In this paper we propose such a method based on the domain knowledge elicited from design level specification. As a proof of concept, we have provided an extension to the DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components) model and validated it on a scenario from the domain of Vehicular Area Networks.

abstract={Given the trend towards mobile computing, the next generation of ubiquitous "smart" services will have to continuously analyze surrounding sensor data. More than ever, such services will rely on data potentially related to personal activities to perform their tasks, e.g. to predict urban traffic or local weather conditions. However, revealing personal data inevitably entails privacy risks, especially when data is shared with high precision and frequency. For example, by analyzing the precise electric consumption data, it can be inferred if a person is currently at home, however this can empower new services such as a smart heating system. Access control (forbid or grant access) or anonymization techniques are not able to deal with such trade-off because whether they completely prohibit access to data or lose source traceability. Blurring techniques, by tuning data quality, offer a wide range of trade-offs between privacy and utility for services. However, the amount of ubiquitous services and their data quality requirements lead to an explosion of possible configurations of blurring algorithms. To manage this complexity, in this paper we propose a platform that automatically adapts (at runtime) blurring components between data owners and data consumers (services). The platform searches the optimal trade-off between service utility and privacy risks using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to adapt the underlying communication platform. We evaluate our approach on a sensor network gateway and show its suitability in terms of i) effectiveness to find an appropriate solution, ii) efficiency and scalability. Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) integration in a Cyber Physical System (CPS) is becoming one of the most important research topics for increasing the adaptability, autonomy, efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability in the wireless automation systems. Due the complexity of the CPS, simulators and emulators have to be used to replace the real experiments in order to provide necessary feedback and facilities for this regard. Although the simulators are open source, flexible, extensible and full integrated in a mathematical modelling tools, the external connection at a physical level and the direct interaction with the process control via the WSN in the CPSs is very poor. This paper proposes a new simulation module to control a wireless cyber-physical system, by integrating LabVIEW development environment for a visual programming language from National Instruments, and COOJA, a cross level wireless sensor network simulator. The developed software module, called 'GILOO' (Graphical Integration of Labview and cOOja) enables to develop and to debug control policies in a simulated or realistic scenario, using the virtual environment or the hardware module, such as the National Instruments Data Acquisition (SCADA), the FPGA platform, the CompactRio, etc. The designed GILOO module has been experimentally tested and preliminary results are shown in this paper. In detail, a smart home mock-up is proposed to verify its correct behavior and to realize the networked control of an indoor LED lighting system. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Most of the currently deployed integrated home management products require an experienced technician to install and configure the system. In this paper, we build upon the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, with the aim of delivering networked solutions that enable multi-node wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to connect to the Internet in a secure, simple and efficient way. We also describe the design and implementation of a smart-home management system. The system is composed of a lightweight tool with an intuitive user interface for commissioning of IP-enabled WSNs. The solution includes a visual programming interface with a common framework for discovering smart home services on the WSN, and a code analysis and translation engine to generate Python code. This engine analyses the application rules defined with the graphical user interface and translates them into distributed application scripts. The system also includes modules to plan the optimization of the deployment, and deploy and start the generated code. In this paper we present a prototype of the system, with the visual programming solution and code generation module. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Design automation tools evolved to support the princIPle of 'separation of concerns' to manage engineering complexity. Accordingly, we find tool suites that are vertically integrated with limited support (even intention) for horizontal integratability (i.e. integration across discIPlinary boundaries). CPS challenges these established boundaries and with this - market conditions. The question is how to facilitate reorganization and create the foundation and technologies for composable CPS design tool chains that enables reuse of existing commercial and open source tools? In this paper we describe some of the lessons learned in the design and implementation of a design automation tool suite for complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) in the vehicle domain. The tool suite followed a model- and component-based design approach to match the significant increase in design productivity experienced in several narrowly focused homogeneous domains, such as signal processing, control and aspects of electronic design. The primary challenge in the undertaking was the tremendous heterogeneity of complex cyber-physical systems (CPS), where such as vehicles has not yet been achieved. This paper describes some of the challenges addressed and solution approaches to building a comprehensive design tool suite for complex CPS. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The mission of the Personalized Energy Reduction Cyber-physical System (PERCS) is to create new possibilities for improving building operating efficiency, enhancing grid reliability, avoiding costly power interruptions, and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. PERCS proposes to achieve these outcomes by engaging building occupants as partners in a user-centered smart service platform. Using a non-intrusive load monitoring approach, PERCS uses a single sensing point in each home to capture smart electric meter data in real time. The household energy signal is disaggregated into individual load signatures of common appliances (e.g., air conditioners), yielding near real-time appliance-level energy information. Users interact with PERCS via a mobile phone platform that provides household- and appliance-level energy feedback, tailored recommendations, and a competitive game tied to energy use and behavioral changes. PERCS challenges traditional energy management approaches by directly engaging occupant as key elements in a technological system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Resiliency and reliability is of paramount impor- tance for energy cyber physical systems. Electrical protection systems including detection elements such as Distance Relays and actuation elements such as Breakers are designed to protect the system from abnormal operations and arrest failure propagation by rapidly isolating the faulty components. However, failure in the protection devices themselves can and do lead to major system events and fault cascades, often leading to blackouts. This paper augments our past work on Temporal Causal Diagrams (TCD), a modeling formalism designed to help reason about the failure progressions by (a) describing a way to generate the TCD model from the system specification, and (b) understand the system failure dynamics for TCD reasoners by configuring simulation models. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Spatial behavioral types encode information on the tempospatial behavior of components acting in the physical space. That makes it possible to utilize the well established concept of type systems with its well studied benefits for programming languages, e.g., fast automatic detection of incompatibilities and coercion, also in the cyber-physical world of domains such as embedded systems. So, spatial behavioral types support development and better maintenance of systems leading to a reduction of errors, improvement of safety and, in consequence, lower expenditure. In this position paper, we summarize existing work and develop our ideas for a spatial behavioral type concept. In particular, we turn our attention to making the spatial behavioral types easily usable by non-experts. Besides of a semantics that resembles traditional types systems, our method offers a syntax based on easily comprehensible regular expressions while systems can be verified using fully-automatic tools. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={The introduction of computing tools to Architecture, Engineering & Construction (AEC) industry has enabled the professionals to navigate successfully from traditional design/drafting to Computer Aided Design/Drafting (CADD). Furthermore, the industry is slowly transitioning towards sophisticated Building Information Modelling (BIM), which necessitates the integration of domain specific knowledge into the BIM authoring tools. The approach presented in this paper elucidates the development of rule-based BIM objects which allows a designer to create building models within the rules of Modular Coordination (MC). With this development, a designer will be able to use MC standards to size and locate building objects in a modular reference frame. Integration of rules of MC with BIM authoring tool will enhance the design process and allow designers to automate some complex modelling/documentation activities requiring no design expertise. The development of rule-based BIM objects exploits the parametric modelling capabilities of BIM authoring tools in addition to visual programming tool to automate the modelling process. The research first explains development of rule based BIM objects which is extended to streamline the overall design process. The presented approach discusses the customization of BIM authoring tool for modelling a residential facility in MC using axial planning of structural elements. In the prototype system, the designer is guided by specific rules and constraints while providing sufficient options to develop variegated configuration. The integration of design rules of MC standards with BIM application will be influential to increase radical use of BIM for built environment especially in the prefabrication industry. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={This paper discusses the application of gamification techniques in the Ambient Intelligence context. A three-layer framework for ambient intelligence based on the concept of interconnection among all actors involved in the intelligent environment is first delineated. Then, mechanisms for user-driven creation and modification of environment behavior are advocated in the user layer. For this purpose, event-condition-action rules are promoted in literature. With this position paper we would like to suggest that user interfaces for rule construction must be integrated with proper techniques for user engagement and motivation, such as those proposed in the gamification theory. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Recent advances, increasing affordability and popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are opening exciting new ways of interaction and sensing for mobile device users. Furthermore, the great acceptance of smart mobile devices in our daily lives makes possible various ludic experiences, which could be greatly improved with IoT technologies. This new setting opens many opportunities for design and development of Pervasive Games for the IoT. In this work, we propose a palette of canonic interaction models and gamification tactics that can be combined for the design of new Pervasive IoT Game experiences. Subsequently, we present the methodology and results of a validation interview regarding our model with experienced game designers. Finally, we present a case study for a Pervasive IoT Game, also giving an overview of our middleware for mobile communication as well as its extension for IoT, discussing the possibilities of implementing new Pervasive IoT Games using it. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2015.},

abstract={Location information of sensor nodes plays a critical role in many wireless sensor network (WSN) applications and protocols. Although many localization algorithms have been proposed in recent years, they usually target at dense networks and perform poorly in sparse networks. In this paper, we propose two component-based localization algorithms that can localize many more nodes in sparse networks than the state-of-the-art solution. We first develop the Basic Common nodes-based Localization Algorithm, namely BCLA, which uses both common nodes and measured distances between adjacent components to merge components. BCLA outperforms CALL, the state-of-the-art component-based localization algorithm that uses only distance measurements to merge components. In order to further improve the performance of BCLA, we further exploit the angular information among nodes to merge components, and propose the Component-based Localization with Angle and Distance information algorithm, namely CLAD. We prove the merging conditions for BCLA and CLAD, and evaluate their performance through extensive simulations. Simulations results show that, CLAD can locate more than 90 percent of nodes in a sparse network with average node degree 7.5, while CALL can locate only 78 percent of nodes in the same scenario. © 2015 KSII.},

abstract={To reduce the complexity associated with application-specific tuning of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), dynamic profiling enables an accurate view of an application's runtime behavior, such that the network can be reoptimized at runtime in response to changing application behavior or environmental conditions. However, the dynamic profiling must be able to accurately capture application behavior without incurring significant runtime overheads. Since application- and sensor-specific constraints dictate the profiling requirements and tolerated overheads, designers require design assistance to quickly evaluate and select appropriate profiling methodologies. To increase designer productivity, we formulate profiling methodology design guidelines based on extensive evaluation and analysis of a variety of profiling methodologies suitable for dynamically monitoring WSNs with respect to network traffic overhead, power, and code impacts associated with each method. While energy consumption increases are reasonable, ranging from 0.5% to 2.6%, network traffic, code size, and computation time overheads can be as high as 66.2%, 75.9%, and 136.6%, respectively. Our results show that these overhead variations are highly application specific, and a single profiling method is not suitable for all types of application behavior, thus necessitating, application-specific profiling methodology customization. To facilitate rapid development of these profiling methodologies, we present a profiler-customization methodology consisting of a code generator module, overhead estimation module, and profile data management module. Using our profiling-customization methodology, designers can rapidly evaluate the overhead of different profiling methodologies, and automatically integrate the most appropriate methodology into the application at design time. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel technique for the implementation of substrate integrated waveguide components based on paper substrate. The aim of the work is to develop a new class of microwave devices where the main advantages are the eco-compatibility and the low cost. These aspects match the requirements of microwave components for the new generation wireless sensor networks. The key points of this work are the manufacturing process based on physical etching of a metal layer and the implementation of a substrate integrated waveguide components on paper. In order to verify the reliability of the manufacturing process, two preliminary designs are proposed: A two poles band-pass filter and a cavity backed antenna both operating at 4 GHz. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Home Manager is an agent-based application for the control of an intelligent home, where the house is seen as an intelligent environment made of independent devices that participate to an agent society. The society is governed by a coordination infrastructure aimed at satisfying the users goals and preferences (lighting, temperature, etc.) while achieving the global house policies and objectives (e.g. energy saving) in a highlyconfigurable way. In the existing prototype, designed mostly to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the above approach, the testbed house was kept intentionally simple, with a limited number of rooms, user types, control devices and policies, and the infrastructure implementation lacked some features. The recent, widespread adoption of smart mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) enabling mobile connectivity has dramatically changed the reference scenario: users now expect at least to be able to monitor, and possibly control, their home devices in mobility, and in fact all major vendors now offer some app for this purpose. Yet, this is just the basic step: exploiting the situated connectivity enabled by GPS and the other geo-localisation techniques embedded in today's smartphones, novel pervasive scenarios can be devised that could not even be imagined in the past years. This aspect is developed in the Butlers architecture, which provides a general framework and reference model for intelligent home management where the smart home is managed by an intelligent butler and interacts with its inhabitants taking into account their habits, behavior, location, preferences and any other sort of information to anticipate their needs and support their goals. In this context, this paper presents the novel "Butler-ised" Home Manager, that evolves the previous system in the Butlers perspective: the new prototype not only supports the remote control of the house appliances via an Android app, but exploits the user position, tracked via geo-localisation, to anticipate the user's needs in a simple, yet significant, scenario - namely, autonomously switching the house oven on when discovering that the user has just bought a take-away pizza in his/her way back home.

abstract={The lifetime of battery operated sensor nodes is a critical issue. In the case of event driven applications where events take place infrequently, most of the energy is wasted in idle listening by the sensor nodes. The sensor node in continuous idle listening mode drains the batteries approximately in two days. This paper describes a passive wake-up circuit (PWUC), designed for 2.45 GHz ISM band, to suppress the idle listening by waking-up the sensor nodes asynchronously. The proposed PWUC consists of receiving antenna, RF rectifier and matching network. The impedance and number of stages of the RF rectifier have been optimized to yield the maximum sensitivity and conversion efficiency. The lumped component based external matching network has also been proposed to boost-up the received input voltage through antenna. The purpose behind the use of external matching network is to reduce the fabrication cost of RF rectifier. Very few realizations of passive wake-up circuits are reported in the literature and none of them presents the sensitivity and global conversion efficiency above -11 dBm and 30-40%, respectively. The designed PWUC gives an output voltage of 1.8 V for a -23 dBm received RF power and a 1 M load, which translates to 69% global power conversion efficiency (GPCE). RF rectifier is designed in UMC 180-nm 1P6M CMOS standard process. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Extreme diversity of application requirements and a large number of different available protocols are key characteristics of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). There is a need for a systematic approach to rapidly compose and optimize application specific protocol stacks in an automated fashion. In this article we present the design, implementation and performance evaluation of CONFab, a framework for automatic protocol stack composition founded on the component based optimization approach. We treat a protocol stack as a collection of interdependent configurable components and have a goal to find the most suitable composition of components, as well as optimal parameters selection of individual components in an optimal fashion. CONFab captures a deployment scenario description, relates it to the desired performance metrics, and suggests suitable protocol stacks and parameter settings. It utilizes an ontology centric knowledge base to select components from a pool of alternatives and reason on their compatibility, thus creating appropriate protocol stacks. The framework is equipped with a number of additional plugins that allow, for instance, incorporating feedback from deployed systems and user inputs to anticipate network performance. The plugin mechanism also enables incorporating further advanced optimization routines, such as genetic algorithms, which can be used for optimization of component parameters and efficient exploration of the corresponding state space. We use a set of well-known medium access control and routing protocols to validate the framework on the Indriya testbed in different user specified application and deployment conditions. Our experimental results show that CONFab framework with its component based design is a powerful enabler in obtaining protocol stacks that suit application requirements and thereby achieving high performance characteristics for the network. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We present a context-oriented approach to design and implement self-adaptive component-based software in resource-constrained Cyber physical Systems (CPSs). Because of unpredictable environment dynamics, developers must design and implement CPS software to dynamically adapt to widely different situations. Our approach provides design concepts and language support to meet this requirement against severe resource constraints. To this end, we bring a notion of context-oriented design and programming down to platforms that-because of extreme resource constraints-currently leverage fairly undisciplined design techniques and rather rudimentary component-based frameworks. Early results demonstrate that our approach improves the quality of the resulting implementations facilitating testing, maintenance, and evolution at the price of a negligible system overhead. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditional shopping malls experience the effects of expanding online shopping. In addition, social media grew as a platform for customer orientation and expression. In-mall retail must respond. We take the customer journey as the guiding model for customer experience building and focus on converting cross-channel built customer expectation into enriched customer experiences in in-mall stores. We focus on the in-mall part of the journey but recognize the need to engage with customers in other parts of the journey and on social media. That is where the word-of-mouth spreads nowadays. We develop a 'u-retail' process model and a cyber-physical system concept for a mall: we combine a mall website, mobile apps and interactive storefronts containing Facebook processes into an integrating system. Customers can manipulate info and processes displayed on the interactive storefront through touch or mobile devices. The Facebook shopping-with-online-friends process inserts real-time feedback from social media friends in the storefront window. We show how 'gamification' and trust and loyalty breeding can be employed. Mall and retailers attract customers in a collective manner, from parking services to package deals. Cross-channel customer tracking is part of the concept, providing a view on both online and offline communities. Ubiquitous tracking of customers foster deep customer relation and experience of data. We implemented a first partly surrogate prototype to validate the concept. This partly empirical, partly designed experimental implementation can itself be a big data tool for scientists and retailers to acquire deeper insights. The concept can be generalized to other social contexts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates service control for IoT gadget platform by using web intent. The difference from legacy device-connected service is that it follows the Web's virtue loose coupling of service components. For loose coupling of these components based on the web technologies, it requires light-weight service logic for limited devices like sensor. To support loose coupling service components, proposed method manipulates Web intent which is a framework for web-based inter-application communication and service discovery. In order to show the web intent based service mashups, a meeting room reservation scenario using Google Calendar is demonstrated. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The Environmental IoT is a project where we investigate the potential of an integrated distributed system consisting of an Internet of Things (IoT) and a Cloud Computing infrastructure. The resulting complex distributed system will be used to support deep understanding of the natural environment inter-dependencies and the management of the natural environment through appropriate interventions. In this paper, we discuss our approach to program this resulting complex distributed system with high-level system specifications in the environmental science context. The high-level specification encapsulates environmental science concepts and conveys the system's overall goals. The approach consists of three refinement steps that translate the high-level specification into the accordingly behaviour on the resulting distributed system. This process captures the abstract requirements of scientists and supports runtime adaptation. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Application of mobile and cyber-physical systems play an important role in cognitive infocommunications, especially in the Socio-Cognitive ICT area, because they are able to facilitate the requested information to users quickly. The Android platform is a good foundation for such systems since it runs on a wide variety of devices and provides some advanced mechanisms for integrating loosely coupled components. These capabilities facilitate efficient component-based development. However, these mechanisms also introduce some difficulties into the development process. On one hand, some functionalities are not encapsulated into a single piece of code but have to be implemented and configured at several distinct source files. On the other hand, it is easy to break the consistency among these artefacts. In this paper, we report on our work in progress tool, which addresses these issues by modeling commonly used functionalities in Android applications and generating a skeleton for the implementation. We also report on the design of this tool. The tool and the experiences of its development will be useful for software developers that aspire to create code generators and cognitive infocommunications related mobile applications based on the Android platform. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper a suitable system based on a multisensory platform is presented, which is appropriate for detecting sources of odorant. Moreover, it is capable of processing and collaborating so that the search can be developed individually or through collaborative work among nodes with similar characteristics. The system described has been developed based on a graphical programming platform that supports events oriented towards instrumentations and SCADA systems. A prototype has been developed where in 90% of the tests the robots found the odorant source with a margin of tolerable error. With the implemented collaborative system the computational burden has been reduced almost 50%, while the searching time of the odorant source has also been reduced. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Deployment of medical devices on human body in unsupervised environment makes their operation safety critical. Software errors such as unbounded memory access or unreachable critical alarms can cause life threatening consequences in these medical cyber-physical systems (MCPSes), where software in medical devices monitor and control human physiology. Further, implementation of complex control strategy in inherently resource constrained medical devices require careful evaluation of runtime characteristics of the software. Such stringent requirements causes errors in manual implementation, which can be only detected by static analysis tools possibly inflicting high cost of redesigning. To avoid such inefficiencies this paper proposes an automatic code generator with assurance on safety from errors such as out-of-bound memory access, unreachable code, and race conditions. The proposed code generator was evaluated against manually written code of a software benchmark for sensors BSNBench in terms of possible optimizations using conditional X propagation. The generated code was found to be 9.3% more optimized than BSNBench code. The generated code was also tested using static analysis tool, Frama-c, and showed no errors. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={The recent increase in the ubiquity and connectivity of computing devices allows forming large-scale distributed systems that respond to and influence activities in the real world (typically called smart Cyber-Physical Systems - sCPS). Examples of such systems include intelligent vehicle navigation, autonomous operation of smart buildings and civil infrastructure, emergency coordination in case of disaster, and even interactive distributed games. Engineering sCPS is typically very challenging because of their inherent dynamicity, open-endedness, autonomicity, and close relation to the real world. The goal of this tutorial is to acquaint the participants with the challenges of engineering sCPS and to explain and demonstrate a novel approach based on autonomic component ensembles that provides means (methods and tools) for relatively seamless design and development of sCPS.

abstract={Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) or Internet of Things systems are typically formed by a myriad of many small interconnected devices. This underlying hardware infrastructure raises new challenges in the way we administrate the software layer of these systems. Indeed, the limited computing power and battery life of each node combined with the very distributed nature of these systems, greatly adds complexity to distributed software layer management. In this paper we propose a new middleware dedicated to CPS to enable the management of software deployment and the dynamic reconfiguration of these systems. Our middleware is inspired from the Component Based Systems and the model@runtime paradigm which has been adapted to the context of Cyber Physical Systems. We have conducted an initial evaluation on a typical Cyber Physical Systems hardware infrastructure which demonstrates the feasibility of providing a model@runtime middleware for these systems.

abstract={The involvement of formal methods is indispensable for modern software engineering. This especially holds for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In order to deal with the complexity and heterogeneity of the design, model-based engineering is widely used. The complexity of detailed verification in the final source code makes it imperative to introduce formal methods earlier in the design process. Because of the widespread use of customized modeling languages (domain-specific modeling languages, DSMLs), it is crucial to formally specify the DSML, and verify if the model meets fundamental correctness criteria. This is achieved by specifying behavioral and structural semantics of the modeling language. Significant model-driven tools have emerged incorporating advanced model checking methods that can provide some assurance regarding the quality and correctness of the models. However, the code generated from these models, using auto code generators remains circumspect, since the correctness of the code generators cannot be assumed as a given, and remains intractable to prove. Therefore, we propose a pragmatic approach, instead of verifying explicit implementation of code generator, verifies the correctness of the generated code with respect to a specific set of user-defined properties to establish that the code-generators are property-preserving. In order to make the verification workflow conducive to domain engineers, who are not often trained in formal methods, we include a mechanism for high-level specification of temporal properties using pattern-based verification templates. The presented toolchain leverages state-of-the-art verification tools, and a small case-study illustrates the approach. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems typically involve a large number of mobile autonomous devices that closely interact with each other and their environment. Standard design and development techniques from the embedded domain fail to accurately model the dynamics of such systems and, hence, there is an increasing need for new programming models and abstractions. Component-based design approaches are a promising solution to manage the complexity of large-scale dynamic systems. However, existing such approaches either do not accurately model transitory interactions between components - which are typical of cyber-physical systems - or do not provide guarantees for real-time behavior which is essential in many safety-critical applications. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we present a component-based design technique based on DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components). The DEECo framework allows modeling large-scale dynamic systems by a set of interacting components. In contrast to other component-based design approaches from the literature, DEECo provides mechanisms to describe transitory interactions between components. We introduce necessary extensions to the DEECo design flow and integrate it with real-time analysis techniques that allow reasoning about timing behavior at the component-description level. Finally, we illustrate the simplicity and usefulness of our approach on a case study consisting of an intelligent crossroad system. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems, e.g., cars, interact with their physical environment, underlie real-time constraints, and exchange messages with each other. An engineer can define their software using a componentbased architecture. An approach to manage the complexity of this task is to separate concerns by specifying the behavior of each component's port independently and, afterwards, synthesizing the component behavior based on the port's behaviors and their dependencies. Though, such a synthesis requires to specify the intra-component dependencies formally. However, for several dependencies that are commonly used, no formal language exists. In this paper, we present a language that enables the specification of all commonly used dependencies in the domain of cyber-physical systems. Moreover, we define the requirements for an intra-component dependency language, provide an extended synthesis process, and introduce the dependency kinds the language shall support.},

abstract={During daily operations of a building, a significant amount of energy is spent on indoor illumination. The choice of different lighting sources and control strategies can notably affect the energy consumption. To achieve the most economical lighting design, a number of factors from both physical and cyber perspectives must be considered. More importantly, these factors must be taken into account during early design phrases of building architecture and automation systems. This paper proposes an infrastructure towards the cyber-physical approach for prototyping indoor illumination. In particular, the distributed lighting automation system is modeled using the IEC 61499 standard. The lighting energy performance of a building is evaluated according to the EN 15193 standard. By integrating the evaluation methodology of energy efficiency in the development of lighting automation systems, adequate indications regarding the correlation between physical and cyber designs can be revealed. The proposed design approach has been demonstrated on a case study house, where impacts of different lighting control strategies on the house's energy efficiency can be quantitatively compared. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a practical framework to bring the cyber-physical block diagram models, such as Ptolemy, to the practice of industrial automation. Cyber-Physical Component (CPC) architecture is suggested. CPC aims at the improvement of design, verification and validation practices in automation of Smart Grid. IEC 61499 standard is used as a basis for this architecture. This architecture addresses several design software and system engineering challenges: right equilibrium between abstract representation and executability and round-trip engineering. An CPC exhibit such properties as portability, interoperability and configurability thanks to the reliance on open standards. The use of time stamp based execution paradigm adds determinism and predictability at the run-time. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Model- and component-based design have yielded dramatic increase in design productivity in several narrowly focused homogeneous domains, such as signal processing, control and aspects of electronic design. However, significant impact on the design and manufacturing of complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as vehicles has not yet been achieved. This paper describes challenges of and solution approaches to building a comprehensive design tool suite for complex CPS. The primary driver for the OpenMETA tool chain was to push the boundaries of the "correct-by-construction" principle to decrease significantly the costly design-build-test-redesign cycles in design flows. In the discussions we will focus on the impact of heterogeneity in modeling CPS. This challenge is compounded by the need for rapidly evolving the design flow by changing/updating the selection of modeling languages, analysis and verification tools and synthesis methods. Based on our experience with the development of OpenMETA and with the evaluation of its performance in a complex CPS design challenge we argue that the current vertically integrated, discipline-specific tool chains for CPS design need to be complemented with horizontal integration layers that support model integration, tool integration and design process integration. This paper will examine the OpenMETA technical approach to construct the new integration layers, provides and overview of the technical framework we established for their implementation and summarize our experience with their application. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Developing software for dynamic cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a complex task. One has to deal with the dynamicity and unreliability of the physical environment where the software resides in, while, at the same time, provide sufficient levels of dependability and scalability. Although emerging software engineering abstractions, such as dynamic ad-hoc component ensembles, provide a convenient way to structure software for dynamic CPS, they need to be mapped to robust decentralized execution schemes in real-life settings. A particular challenge in this context is the robust distributed data dissemination in dynamic networks. Gossip-based communication stands as a promising solution to this challenge. We argue, that exploitation of application-specific information, software architecture in particular, has a large potential for improving the robustness and performance of gossip-based communication. This paper proposes a synergy between high-level architectural models and low-level communication models to effectively enable application-specific gossiping in component-based systems. The synergy is exemplified on the DEECo component model which is tailored to the needs and specifics of CPS, and evaluated on an emergency coordination case study with realistic network configurations. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex distributed decentralized systems of cooperating mobile and stationary devices which closely interact with the physical environment. Although Component-Based Development (CBD) might seem as a viable solution to target the complexity of smart CPS, existing component models scarcely cope with the open-ended and very dynamic nature of smart CPS. This is especially true for design-time modeling using hierarchical explicit architectures, which traditionally provide an excellent means of coping with complexity by providing multiple levels of abstractions and explicitly specifying communication links between component instances. In this paper we propose a modeling method (materialized in the SOFA NG component model) which conveys the benefits of explicit architectures of hierarchical components to the design of smart CPS. Specifically, we base our method on modeling systems as reference architectures of Software Product Lines (SPL). Contrary to traditional SPL, which is a fully design-time approach, we create SPL configurations at runtime. We do so in a decentralized way by translating the configuration process to the process of establishing component ensembles (i.e. dynamic cooperation groups of components) of our DEECo component model.

abstract={Future cyber-physical systems will behave smart, i.e., they will provide self-*properties and collaborate with each other. Software realizes this smart behavior. In modern cars, a hardware platform consists of up to 100 networked electronic control units (ECUs) that execute the software. As the amount of safety-critical software increases, the task of describing a suitable hardware platform for deploying safety-critical software components to ECUs becomes more complicated. Existing approaches for the definition of a hardware platform do not address the different stakeholder's concerns and do not provide a systematic method. This leads to an error-prone development. In this paper, we identify viewpoints for the stakeholder's concerns and provide a method for the multi-view modeling of hardware platforms. In addition, we support hierarchical and variable horizontal composition of hardware platforms by transferring concepts from component-based software engineering. To test our method, we use an Arduino-based cooperative adaptive cruise control system. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Component-based programming models are well-suited to the design of large-scale, distributed applications because of the ease with which distributed functionality can be developed, deployed, and validated using the models' compositional properties. Existing component models supported by standardized technologies, such as the OMG's CORBA Component Model (CCM), however, incur a number of limitations in the context of cyber physical systems (CPS) that operate in highly dynamic, resource-constrained, and uncertain environments, such as space environments, yet require multiple quality of service (QoS) assurances, such as timeliness, reliability, and security. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents the design of a novel component model called F6COM that is developed for applications operating in the context of a cluster of fractionated spacecraft. Although F6COM leverages the compositional capabilities and port abstractions of existing component models, it provides several new features. Specifically, F6COM abstracts the component operations as tasks, which are scheduled sequentially based on a specified scheduling policy. The infrastructure ensures that at any time at most one task of a component can be active - eliminating race conditions and deadlocks without requiring complicated and error-prone synchronization logic to be written by the component developer. These tasks can be initiated due to (a) interactions with other components, (b) expiration of timers, both sporadic and periodic, and (c) interactions with input/output devices. Interactions with other components are facilitated by ports. To ensure secure information flows, every port of an F6COM component is associated with a security label such that all interactions are executed within a security context. Thus, all component interactions can be subjected to Mandatory Access Control checks by a Trusted Computing Base that facilitates the interactions. Finally, F6COM provides capabilities to monitor task execution deadlines and to configure component-specific fault mitigation actions. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={We present an approach that combines semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool to enable the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users. In contrast to process-driven systems where service mashups are statically defined, this approach makes use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of the presented system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support end users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system. This tool enables users to model the desired state of their smart environment graphically and thus hides the technicalities of the underlying semantics and the reasoning. Possible applications of the presented system include the configuration of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Growing advances in hardware technologies are enabling significant improvements in application performance by the deployment of components to dedicated executable units. This is particularly valid for Cyber Physical Systems in which the applications are partitioned in HW and SW execution units. The growing complexity of such systems, and increasing requirements, both project- and product-related, makes the partitioning decision process complex. Although different approaches to this decision process have been proposed during recent decades, they lack the ability to provide relevant decisions based on a larger number of requirements and project/business constraints. A sound approach to this problem is taking into account all relevant requirements and constraints and their relations to the properties of the components deployed either as HW or SW units. A typical approach for managing a large number of criteria is a multicriteria decision analysis. This, in its turn, requires uniform definitions of component properties and their realization in respect to their HW/SW deployment. The aim of this paper is twofold: a) to provide an architectural metamodel of component-based applications with specifications of their properties with respect to their partitioning, and b) to categorize component properties in relation to HW/SW deployment. The metamodel enables the transition of system requirements to system and component properties. The categorization provides support for architectural decisions. It is demonstrated through a property guideline for the partitioning of the System Automation and Control domain. The guideline is based on interviews with practitioners and researchers, the experts in this domain. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a layered and component based software architecture, which generates semantic software applications, for the purpose of delivering personalized services for residents in Self-Care Homes (SeCH). The architectural core layers accommodate software components which grasp and understand the semantic of various situations we may encounter in SeCH, through a variety of cyber-physical objects which co-exist in pervasive environments used in monitoring SeCH residents. The decision making on appropriate actions in SeCH is based on reasoning created by SWRL enabled OWL ontologies to ensure that in any situation, residents are delivered suitable and personalized healthcare services. The ASeCS architecture has been deployed through component based Java technologies, and uses OWL-API in order to seamlessly incorporate reasoning into software applications. ASeCS is SeCH specific, but provides a window of opportunities for creating modern and flexible software solutions for pervasive healthcare, where decision making solely depends on OWL/SWRL enabled computations. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Self-adaptive component-based architectures facilitate the building of systems able of dynamically adapting to varying execution contexts. Such a dynamic adaptation is particularly relevant in the domain of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where numerous and unexpected changes of the execution context prevail. In this paper, we introduce a reference architecture for WSNs in order to contribute to middleware development for enabling self-adaptive behavior in service-oriented WSNs. This reference architecture follows the autonomic computing model MAPE-K, for making decisions aiming to attend self-adaptive WSN requirements. At the end of this paper, we present a case study to explain how instantiate our reference architecture in order to create a specific concrete middleware for WSN. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={For Safety Critical CPS applications, Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) can provide a framework for formally modeling end-to-end Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). Such a model includes hardware platform model, software architecture model, the real-time bounds on software and hardware components. An AADL model of the system allows early formal analysis of real-time schedulability, end-to-end performance, power, memory requirements and correctness. Multiple tool support for AADL modeling and analysis exists, including software code generator, which glues together software components declared in the software architecture model. Ocarina is one such tool for software generation but it requires that the modeler provides the subprogram code in C/C++ or Ada. For correct-by-construction code synthesis, it is ideal to eliminate manually written code, and instead of using Ocarina as a glue code generator, using it for complete code synthesis from formal models. Support for Esterel and Lustre based specification of subprograms already have been attempted, but they usually specify specific subprogram elements, and the specific code generators are invoked to synthesis C/C++ code and then Ocarina glues them together based on the architectural constraints specified in the AADL model. This means that in a multi-threaded or multi-process software architecture, we still have to maneuver to get correct synchronization code. Moreover, if the granularity of code synthesis is at the function or subprogram level, we cannot gain much towards the goal of correct-by-construction synthesis and we believe that taking advantage of polychronous modeling and code synthesis would be ideal to achieve that goal. In this work, we show how to extend the Ocarina code generator to work with our Polychronous modeling and code synthesis solution to obtain multi-threaded code, improving the code-synthesis granularity from subprograms to processes while guaranteeing the implementation correctness. Moreover, a real-time extension of our polychronous code synthesis can provide the opportunity to enhance the real-time schedulability analysis of AADL. In this paper, we will outline the problem of AADL based model-driven implementation of CPS systems, describe the state-of-art code generation through Ocarina, point out why the extensions we propose are needed, and finally describe our code synthesis extension for multi-threaded code synthesis in our AADL modeling, analysis and code synthesis tool APECS which extends OSATE and Ocarina tools for AADL. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Accurate localization is crucial for wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks. Among the localization schemes, component-based approaches specialize in localization performance. By grouping nodes into increasingly large rigid components, component-based localization algorithms can properly conquer network sparseness and anchor sparseness. However, such design is sensitive to measurement errors. Existing robust localization methods focus on eliminating the positioning error of a single node. Indeed, a single node has two dimensions of freedom in 2D space and only suffers from one type of transformation: translation. As a rigid 2D structure, a component suffers from three possible transformations: translation, rotation, and reflection. A high degree of freedom brings about complicated cases of error productions and difficulties on error controlling. This study is the first work addressing how to deal with ranging noises for component-based methods. By exploiting a set of robust patterns, we present an Error-TOlerant Component-based algorithm (ETOC) that not only inherits the high-performance characteristic of component-based methods, but also achieves robustness of the result. We evaluate ETOC through a real-world sensor network consisting of 120 TelosB motes as well as extensive large-scale simulations. Experiment results show that, comparing with the-state-of-the-art designs, ETOC can work properly in sparse networks and provide more accurate localization results. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This article proposes two models that improve the Principal Component-based Context Compression (PC3) model for contextual information forwarding among sensor nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The proposed models (referred to as iPC3 and oPC3) address issues associated with the control of multivariate contextual information transmission in a stationary WSN. Because WSN nodes are typically battery equipped, the primary design goal of the models is to optimize the amount of energy used for data transmission while retaining data accuracy at high levels. The proposed energy conservation techniques and algorithms are based on incremental principal component analysis and optimal stopping theory. iPC3 and oPC3 models are presented and compared with PC3 and other models found in the literature through simulations. The proposed models manage to extend the lifetime of a WSN application by improving energy efficiency within WSN. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Smart Home market players aim to deploy component-based and service-oriented applications from untrusted third party providers on a single OSGi execution environment. This creates the risk of resource abuse by buggy and malicious applications, which raises the need for resource monitoring mechanisms. Existing resource monitoring solutions either are too intrusive or fail to identify the relevant resource consumer in numerous multi-tenant situations. This paper proposes a system to monitor the memory consumed by each tenant, while allowing them to continue communicating directly to render services. We propose a solution based on a list of configurable resource accounting rules between tenants, which is far less intrusive than existing OSGi monitoring systems. We modified an experimental Java Virtual Machine in order to provide the memory monitoring features for the multi-tenant OSGi environment. Our evaluation of the memory monitoring mechanism on the DaCapo benchmarks shows an overhead below 46%. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) application development is a complex task that requires a wide range of expertise. Currently, the IoT community lacks a development toolkit that enables inexperienced developers to develop IoT prototypes rapidly. Filling this gap, we propose a development toolkit based on a model-driven approach, called IoT Link. IoT Link allows inexperienced developers to compose mash up applications through a graphical domain-specific language that can be easily configured and wired together to create an IoT application. Through visual components, IoT Link encapsulates the complexity of communicating with devices and services on the internet and abstracts them as virtual objects that are accessible through different communication technologies. Consequently, it solves interoperability between heterogeneous IoT components. Based on the visual model, IoT Link is able to generate a complete Java project including an extendable Java code. In a controlled experiment, IoT Link was 42% faster than using a Java library and able to outperform the Java library's user satisfactions. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Location information of sensor nodes is critical to many wireless sensor network (WSN) applications and protocols. Many localization algorithms have been proposed in the past several years. However, they cannot successfully localize all the localizable nodes in sparse networks in which the average node degree is usually less than 10. In this paper, we propose two component based localization algorithms that can localize many more nodes than state-of-the-art solutions in sparse networks. We first develop BCLA that uses both common nodes and measured distances between nodes of adjacent components to merge components. BCLA outperforms CALL in which only distance measurements are used to merge components. In order to further improve the performance of BCLA, we take into account the angular information among nodes when merging components and propose the CLAD algorithm. We prove the merging conditions for both BCLA and CLAD. Simulation results show that CLAD can locate more than 90 percent of nodes in sparse networks with average node degree 7.5, while CALL can locate only 78 percent of nodes in the same scenario. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Resilient computing is defined as the ability of a system to remain dependable when facing changes. To mitigate faults at runtime, dependable systems employ fault tolerance mechanisms such as replication techniques. These mechanisms have to be systematically and rigorously applied in order to guarantee the conformance between the application runtime behavior and its dependability requirements. To this end, we propose architectural concepts for developing resilient computing systems using component-based middleware. The development process of adaptive fault tolerance (AFT) is shortly presented. We then illustrate the benefits of AFT on a Wireless Sensor Network-based application for parking management. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={It is expected that the Internet of Things (IoT) provides the foundational infrastructure for smart cities, and making ICT an enabling technology to meet major challenges associated with climate change, energy efficiency, mobility and future services. On the other hand a smart city with these requirements is usually evolving through incremental automation and integration of new components, that are digital or physical components or smart devices. To handle the growing scale and complexity of a system, an adaptive modelling method is needed for dynamic analysis and verification and/or validation, and integration. In this paper, we consider the case study of a Demand Response (DR) Programme that is to be realized by the deployment of a network of smart meters. Through this case study, we propose a component-based modelling approach and demonstrate how it deals with the growing complex architecture. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficient cooling methods are necessary when living in a tropical climate where high temperatures and high humidity are normal. Air-conditioning units, which are expensive to run and maintain are standard in a majority of houses in Australia's tropic zone due to the design of both historic and modern housing not being fully suited to a tropical region. Significantly, the cost of energy consumption continues to increase. There are simple and inexpensive modifications a homeowner can do to naturally cool the house and preserve energy, such as, painting roofs white, planting screening vegetation and installing shades externally to cover windows, etc. However, many of these alternative techniques are not common knowledge and are not presented to the public in ways that can inform and potentially change behaviour. This paper presents a housing simulation prototype that applies gamification methods to build awareness on ways to reduce cooling power consumption. An interactive guided persuasion methodology is used to educate homeowners about these alternative techniques so they may choose natural cooling methods instead of relying on electrical cooling appliances. The results of the user testing show the simulation design did encourage awareness and motivation to make tangible adaptations to homes. © 2014 SERSC.},

abstract={The rate at which aerospace systems complexity has increased over the past half-century has far outpaced the advancement of design methodologies and product lifecycle management (PLM) processes used to develop those systems. The lack of investment in design methodology and PLM infrastructure has materialized in the form of inefficient and costly aerospace projects that exhibit the typical design-test-build-redesign cycle. This iterative behavior has established itself as the status quo for engineering design and is partly attributed to ill-defined and evolving program requirements, insufficient exploration of the architectural space in early stages of design, widening communication gaps between design and manufacturability, and an inability to capture certain phenomena without physical prototyping and testing. Furthermore, current aerospace systems are commonly characterized by a high parts count, increasingly complex component and subsystem interaction, and tightly coupled software-hardware dependencies. In concert, these attributes, behaviors, and practices associated with aerospace systems design continue to impair our ability to meet the demands of tomorrow without accepting a high-amount of programmatic risk in terms of project timeline and financial investment. This paper offers a new approach to the design and manufacturability of complex aerospace systems and will focus on delivering an informative account of a joint initiative between Dassault Systemes and Georgia Tech that involves the conceptual design of a micro-autonomous system. The micro-autonomous system is designed to support ground troops in reconnaissance missions and fulfill a critical need to provide tactical situational awareness in hostile environments. The authors will use the design of the micro-autonomous system to highlight systems engineering methods and integrated software tool suites that support the ability to facilitate requirements capture and traceability, impose manufacturability concerns early in the design process, and enhance information flow and its harmonization.},

These platforms support multiple concurrent applications managed by multiple actors. Reconfigurable component-models are a viable solution for supporting these scenarios by reducing management and development overhead while promoting software reuse. However, implicit parameter dependencies spanning component compositions make reconfiguration complex and error-prone. This paper proposes composition-safe reparametrization of components. This is accomplished by offering language annotations that allow component developers to make dependencies explicit and network protocols to resolve and enforce parameter constraints. Our approach greatly simplifies reparametrization while imposing minimal runtime overhead. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2014.},

abstract={As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past few years. In order to construct an autonomous and robust biometric security system, this paper explores the application of face recognition technique in wireless sensor networks. Given the limited technological resources of sensor nodes, new challenges remain to be met. In this work, a facial component-based recognition mechanism is firstly applied to ensure the recognition accuracy. Secondly, in order to address the problem of resource constraints, a distributed scheme based on K-d trees is deployed for both the face image transmission and retrieval. According to the simulation results, the proposed method is capable of achieving considerable energy efficiency, while assuring the recognition accuracy. © 2014 Qiaomin Lin et al.},

abstract={Space Plug-and-Play Architecture (SPA), defined by the Air Force Research Laboratory, is a new standard for spacecraft component interconnections (AIAA-S-133-x-2013) providing new capability for managing intelligent components. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Personal Area Network standard are finding increasing use in the home automation and emerging smart energy markets. The network protocol and application layers can be based on the ZigBee standard as defined by the ZigBee Alliance, providing a framework for component-based software that supports solutions from multiple vendors. SPA and ZigBee create self-configuring ad-hoc networks, but differ in their approach. SPA focuses on self-configuring components using wired interconnects while ZigBee forms self-configuring wireless networks. The optimal combination of SPA with ZigBee technology can bring the advantages of both methods to next-generation spacecraft by using self-configuring wireless networks for data and intelligent components with universal SPA-compliant interfaces. Mesh-enabled WSNs provide inherent fault tolerance and SPA provides dynamic fault management leading to low-power, low-cost ancillary sensing solutions for spacecraft.1 © 2014 IEEE.},

Our assumption is that considering these aspects together allows for novel intriguing possibilities. To this end, in this paper we combine home energy management with domotics, coordination technologies, intelligent agents, ambient intelligence, ubiquitous technologies and gamification to devise novel scenarios, where energy monitoring and management is just the basic brick of a much wider and comprehensive home management system. The aim is to control home appliances well beyond energy consumption, combining home comfort, appliance scheduling, safety constraints, etc. with dynamically-changeable users' preferences, goals and priorities. At the same time, usability and attractiveness are seen as key success factors: so, the intriguing technologies available in most houses and smart devices are exploited to make the system configuration and use simpler, entertaining and attractive for users. These aspects are also integrated with ubiquitous and pervasive technologies, geo-localization, social networks and communities to provide enhanced functionalities and support smarter application scenarios, hereby further strengthening technology acceptation and diffusion. Accordingly, we first analyse the system requirements and define a reference multi-layer architectural model - the Butlers architecture - that specifies seven layers of functionalities, correlating the requirements, the corresponding technologies and the consequent value-added for users in each layer. Then, we outline a set of notable scenarios of increasing functionalities and complexity, discuss the structure of the corresponding system patterns in terms of the proposed architecture, and make this concrete by presenting some comprehensive interaction examples as comic strip stories. Next, we discuss the implementation requirements and how they can be met with the available technologies, discuss a possible architecture, refine it in the concrete case of the TuCSoN coordination technology, present a subsystem prototype and discuss its properties in the Butlers perspective. © 2014 Denti.},

abstract={Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) is a promising approach for the development of applications, and has been well adopted in the embedded applications domain in recent years. Wireless Sensor Actuator Networks consisting of resource constrained hardware and platform-specific operating system is one application area where the advantages of MDSE can be exploited. Code-generation is an integral part of MDSE, and using a multi-platform code generator as a part of the approach has several advantages. Due to the automated code-generation, it is possible to obtain time reduction and prevent errors induced due to manual translations. With the use of formal semantics in the modeling approach, we can further ensure the correctness of the source model by means of verification. Also, with the use of network simulators and formal modeling tools, we obtain a verified and validated model to be used as a basis for code-generation. The aim is to build protocols with shorter design to implementation time and efforts, along with higher confidence in the protocol designed.},

abstract={Nowadays, new portable devices are constantly being launched with their ever greater application to an ever growing number of domains. These devices or wearables (from wearable computing) are present in many different areas ranging from healthcare to entertainment, and provide a series of features to enhance the quality of everyday life. When used in conjunction with other wearables, they give rise to wireless body area networks (WBAN) or body area networks (BAN). The large variety of devices along with the lack of standardized services, which means that each designer or engineer must customize the API design, forces developers to implement source code mostly from scratch in order to cope with the heterogeneity of wearables and support their integration on a wider system. The result of these drawbacks is that new device integration is hampered and the time spent on the software development process is increased and these problems are addressed in this paper. We propose a modeldriven approach based on a meta-model which has been designed to define and specify interaction with sensors. Our main aim is to distance developers from specific implementation and to cope with heterogeneous designs. The resulting models, which are instances of the proposed meta-model, are specified in a custom language which we call the wearable markup language (WML). We also introduce the coordinator, i.e. component-based software for handling sensor models and improving the integration of new sensors. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Lower amount of power delivered from piezoelectric based ambient vibration energy harvester devices is a barrier to adopt the technology for different applications. Energy harvesting circuitry can enhance power output to provide a regulated DC supply to the end application. In this paper, various circuit simulations are carried out to investigate output power enhancement. A parametric analysis of a boost circuit simulation using Cadence OrCAD Capture PSpice software with input less than 1 V is carried out to find the optimum parameters including, the switching frequency rise and fall times, duty cycle, inductance and load capacitance value. Simulation results show that passive component based boost converter can significantly increase the voltage output of an ambient vibration based energy harvester. The output voltage increases linearly with the increase of single supply voltage input range 0.1 V to 0.5 V, to the output voltage range of 7 to 35 V. The optimum parameter found for 10 kω load is 100 μH inductor and 1μF load capacitor. A comparison of output performance of the boost circuit with existing literature is presented. The ease of the boost converter circuit will facilitate the development of an efficient piezoelectric energy harvesters for low power applications like automotive, healthcare portable devices, and wireless sensor networks. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In everyday lives, so many events happen around us. Although not all of them are important to us, we have to process them all to be able to isolate the significant events. Consciousness is a constant awareness of the environment, which can be acquired only by such an exhaustive approach. As an autonomous agent, a robot is also required to be conscious, which is not yet properly realized. In this paper, we discuss the strategy to organize various perception technologies to achieve the consciousness of the robots. Especially, an independent process that constantly monitors its surroundings without the intervention of higher processes is proposed. This process, which is called a perception daemon, is discriminated from the traditional component-based approach, where individual perception technology is provided as a passive function so that the service applications should call whenever it is necessary. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents the modeling, functionality and implementation of a modern interactive smart home system, which supports several automations for comfortable and secure living, including an energy management subsystem which cooperates with a rooftop photovoltaic installation. The smart home application was developed in the LabVIEW graphical programming environment, being a challenging task since LabVIEW is primarily targeting data collection and analysis as well as complex measurements and trials in laboratory and industrial environments. However, a lot of attractive capabilities it provides for interfacing and control, processing of sensor input, visual (also known as dataflow or diagrammatic) programming and handy visualization promise a much wider adoption and application field. Consequently, it can be applied efficiently and effortlessly in modern home automation and smart home applications. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Contemporary Wireless Sensor Networks like Smart Offices and Smart Cities are evolving to become multi-purpose application hosting platforms. These WSN platforms can simultaneously support multiple applications which may be managed by multiple actors. Reconfigurable component models have been shown to be viable solutions to reducing the complexity of managing and developing these applications while promoting software re-use. However, implicit parameter dependencies between components make reconfiguration complex and error-prone. Our approach achieves automatic composition-safe re-parametrization of distributed component compositions. To achieve this, we propose the use of language annotations that allow component developers to make these dependencies explicit and constraint-aware network protocols to ensure constraint propagation and enforcement. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Within the design of Cyber Physical Systems, model-based approaches are powerful means to describe and test the behavior of the system. Still, a good methodology is needed to go from the idealized model environment to an implementable system architecture that is capable of dealing with uncertainties in both the physical and the cyber subsystem. This paper presents a concept that explicitly utilizes intervals to express uncertainties in the physical system, the control process and the cyber system to improve the robustness and stability of the design. This interval concept has been integrated in a component-based framework that allows one to describe properties of the components out of which the CPS is composed. With a prototype implementation of the component framework, this paper shows the usefulness of this approach for an exemplary CPS. The results indicate the practical benefits of value intervals for property assessment of composed CPSs which can be exploited at design time as well as run time. © 2013 IEEE.},

By this, we have developed a service robot and robot pilot agent, which can dynamically add and remove sensors and widgets.

abstract={The component-based system development (CBSD) has spawned a variety of methods and modeling technologies that in turn have germinated the opportunity for further application of Cyber-physical Systems (CPS). CBSD provides a reference framework to develop component dynamics of physical characteristics in the physical world of CPS. However, it is debatable to develop a unified modeling language or modeling framework for the purpose of translating between different formal methods employed in multi-domain models because these methods captures their own domain characteristics while ignoring the ones in favor of others-that is, we envisage trade-offs of system properties being made as individual architect design domain-dependent knowledge. This paper presents a theory of modeling physical dynamics based on domain-independent perspective that can enable extending the description of interaction between physical components of CPS and achieve the unified modeling approach in terms of extensibility and scalability. We treat the interaction activities between physical components as general energy elapse process. A key benefit of our approach is to provide an extensible point to define specific physical characteristics of the individual physical domain. © 2013 Binary Information Press.},

abstract={Cyber-physical Systems introduce several new requirements for modelling and executing autonomous processes. Current workflow languages are not able to completely fulfil these requirements, as they mostly lack expressiveness and flexibility. In this paper, we therefore present a new workflow language for formalizing processes within heterogeneous and dynamic environments. Our approach is highly modelbased and uses aspects of component-based software engineering. We present an object-oriented meta-model for describing processes, which enables the hierarchical composition of process components and leverages reusability. In addition, a domain-specific model is used for typification of process elements. Due to the objectorientation, we are able to easily extend our models and create variants of processes. Type-based modelling and polymorphism enable the dynamic selection of appropriate process steps at runtime, creating flexible processes. We present a graphical editor and a distributed execution engine for our meta-model. In addition, we discuss the use of semantic technologies for smart workflows. © 2013 DIME UNIVERSITÀ DI GENOVA.},

abstract={The judgment of global production networks is facing three major challenges. The complexity, measurable through the huge solution space, as well as the time-consuming preparation of a decision in line with the limited amount of time of the final decision makers - CEOs and upper management. The experience from several industry projects showed the demand to transfer and apply the concept of gamification in a cyber-physical environment to decision-making in Global Footprint Design. Smart IT tools, which support the intuition and practical knowledge of the decision maker but do not finally make the decision for them, are needed. Based on general criteria for successful gamified IT tools three specific requirements for judging global production networks are derived: value creation, ludic goal orientation and autonomous discovery. The major challenges and these specified principles of gamification are addressed within the scope of an IT tool which simplifies and improves complex global footprint decisions by employing elements of gamification. It is analysed to which degree the criteria are already fulfilled, which benefits this prototype of a gamified IT tool can offer and what future research has to be conducted in order to fully let CEOs game their global footprint strategy. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel design of a system for using smart mobile robots to deploy a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for different optical fibre sensors, allowing for potential applications where there is a remote and harsh monitoring environment and allowing for the advantages of the optical fibre technology for the sensor itself to be used. The platform which was designed is comprised of a smart mobile robot, an optical fibre sensor module and a WSN module integrated with a localization component based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which has important advantages for mobile sensing and tracking, flexible deployment and mesh networking. The design principle and implementation-related issues for the platform have been discussed in this study. To investigate the performance of the mobile WSN platform, an experiment simulating measurement in a real environment has been performed. With the positive experimental data obtained, the functionalities of the platform are successfully demonstrated, which enables the real-time monitoring and transmission of sensor data and in addition estimated positional information. The exploitation of this kind of mobile WSN platform with fibre optic sensors is expected to make an impact on many applications, including those where advanced optical fibre sensing is particularly advantageous, yet where conventional WSNs cannot meet the requirements of the total sensing system. © 2013 SPIE.},

abstract={Sensor data can be useful in various applications, but it is also critical in some areas, such as health, safety and finance. In particular, in a time critical environment, temporal correlation of streaming sensor data should be monitored. A run-time monitor is embedded in the server for such applications, in order to detect erroneous conditions, and perform appropriate reactions in a timely manner. However, modification of the monitor may require stop and restart of the server, in order to take effect. This kind of option is not permissible where the server should be performing continuously. In this paper, we propose a component based reconfigurable sensor network monitor designed for handling time critical requirements. In order to allow dynamic modification, we implement both the server and the monitor on the Fractal Component model, which enables us to reconfigure the system architecture in run-time. For detecting violation of the timing condition, we specify timing constraints, and design the monitor on Fractal Aspect Component. The architecture can be formally verified by Fractal-ADL and Alloy. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, by developing a smart cruise control system. We aim to provide guidance to construct a monitoring system in a dynamic and time critical environment.},

abstract={Ambient Health Monitoring is becoming increasingly important for supporting proactive self-monitoring as part of a healthy lifestyle and as an enabler of appropriate healthcare services in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). However, the heterogeneity of available context sources and AAL infrastructure components hinders the design of holistic systems. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive modular system approach for integrating heterogeneous context sources, including: stationary sensor networks in AAL infrastructure; wireless medical device sensors; embedded mobile device sensors; as well as virtual sensors. We outline the potential use cases of the system by presenting a prototype lifelogging application for Android, which dynamically integrates several sensor types into a personal health record, with a special focus on activity recognition. The application also demonstrates the usage of gamification methods as a persuasive means of enhancing the intrinsic motivation of users towards a personalized healthy lifestyle. © 2013 ICST.},

abstract={Various emerging applications enabled by wireless sensor networks demand new and versatile MAC algorithms. These MAC protocols should be able to adapt to varying application requirements and deployment conditions. In this paper, we present a component based scheme for enabling fast prototyping of MAC protocols using a lightweight toolchain. Our toolchain allows run-time MAC protocol reconfiguration by controlling the data path and the execution flow of the constituent components. Our approach of composing protocols based on common MAC components aims at reducing the protocol prototyping efforts. Moreover, our toolchain implemented for various sensor nodes provides a platform independent MAC meta-language which simplifies the protocol designing, testing and debugging processes. Empirical tests conducted on commercially available sensor nodes show that our approach enables run-time reconfiguration for MAC protocols with affordable memory consumption and execution overhead. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) allows physical objects to be connected on the Internet. Objects in the IoT have identities, attributes and personalities in the virtual world. These objects are integrated together using intelligent interfaces. The IoT has a lot of challenges and issues that require further research before achieving a global scale. This paper presents a generic IoT architecture to modularize physical objects into the digital world. It demonstrates that the future IoT can be designed based on component-based communication and existing communication standards. To achieve integration both on a device and semantic level, physical objects and services can be virtualised as instantiated middleware components. By building ontologies, third-parties can also customize objects and services. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the continuous development of brain imaging technology, it has become a hot area of neuroscience and information technology to research the human emotion changes, cognitive status and psychiatric disorders. In recent years, any smart device can be used as a terminal sensor in the Internet of Things for information interaction. It will be the new research aspect for Brain-Computer Interface(BCI) to regard the human brain (the most intelligent device) as a terminal sensor in the Internet of Things and to construct the network based on the human brains (we name it as Internet of Brains). In this paper, a model of wearable affective computing was proposed for discriminating different emotional states and constructing the Internet of Brains, by means of effective connectivity of EEG-based brain network. Firstly, we proposed a rational emotion-induced psychological experiment to collect the EEG data under different emotional states. Then, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to decompose different independent components based on different emotional states; Granger Causality Analysis (GCA) was utilized to detect the interactive dependencies between each independent component in order to construct the causal connectivity brain network (CCBN); Dynamic characteristics, including causal density and causal flow of the CCBN, were extracted based on Graph Theory. Finally, the corresponding law between characteristics of EEG pattern and "inner" emotional state was discovered to establish affective computing model. Furthermore, the model of wearable affective computing was constructed based on above law with the portable EEG acquisition device, and prototype system of wearable affective computing based on Internet of Brains was achieved for BCI. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless reprogramming of sensor nodes is a critical requirement in long-lived wireless sensor networks (WSNs) addressing several concerns, such as fixing bugs, upgrading the operating system and applications, and adapting applications behavior according to the physical environment. In such resource-poor platforms, the ability to efficiently delimit and reconfigure the necessary portion of sensor software - instead of updating the full binary image - is of vital importance. However, most existing approaches in this field have not been adopted widely to date due to the extensive use of WSN resources or lack of generality. In this article, we therefore considerWSNprogramming models and runtime reconfiguration models as two interrelated factors and we present an integrated approach for addressing efficient reprogramming in WSNs. The middleware solution we propose, REMOWARE, is characterized by mitigating the cost of post-deployment software updates on sensor nodes via the notion of in situ reconfigurability and providing a component-based programming abstraction in order to facilitate the development of dynamic WSN applications. Our evaluation results show that REMOWARE imposes a very low energy overhead in code distribution and component reconfiguration and consumes approximately 6% of the total code memory on a TELOSB sensor platform. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={A main challenge of programming component-based software is to ensure that the components continue to behave in a reasonable manner even when communication becomes unreliable. We propose a process calculus, the Quality Calculus, for programming software components where it becomes natural to plan for default behaviour in case the ideal behaviour fails due to unreliable communication and thereby to increase the quality of service offered by the systems. The development is facilitated by a SAT-based robustness analysis to determine whether or not the code is vulnerable to unreliable communication. This is illustrated on the design of a fragment of a wireless sensor network. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Software development for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a sophisticated activity as these systems are inherently complex. The engineering of CPS requires composition and interaction of diverse distributed software modules. Describing both, a system's architecture and behavior in integrated models, yields many advantages to cope with this complexity: the models are platform independent, can be decomposed to be developed independently by experts of the respective fields, are highly reusable and may be subjected to formal analysis. In this paper, we introduce a code generation framework for the MontiArcAutomaton modeling language. CPS are modeled as Component Connector architectures with embedded I/Oω automata. During development, these models can be analyzed using formal methods, graphically edited, and deployed to various platforms. For this, we present four code generators based on the MontiCore code generation framework, that implement the transformation from MontiArcAutomaton models to Mona (formal analysis), EMF Ecore (graphical editing), and Java and Python (deployment). Based on these prototypes, we discuss their commonalities and differences as well as language and application specific challenges focusing on code generator development. © Gesellschaft für Informatik, Bonn 2013.},

abstract={Cyber-physical robot system involves a variety of disciplines including software engineering, control engineering, hardware engineering etc. The multi-disciplinary nature and time criticality make computing in CPRS significantly different from traditional computer system. Traditional design approach uses a separate design strategy to develop different domain part independently, which leads to a lot of design paradox and conflicts. This paper attempts to derme the relationships of the multi-view model at the meta-model level based on model-based design and component-based design. A uniform graphic environment and toolsets for CPRS modeling, verification and implementation are supplied. The approach is an attempt to support CPRS design in an integrated and swift way, at the same time guarantee the system function and performance requirements. © 2013 IEEE.},

Distributed publish/subscribe systems are naturally suited for processing events in smart home environments. However, technologies which support privacy protection and assure system efficiency are still largely unexplored. Inspired from the requirements of distributed system for smart work, we design a privacy-aware distributed pub-sub system with parameterized attribute. We illustrate the potential of our approach with a distinctive use cases, and ther present a component-based view of the proposed system. The experimental results show our system with parameterized attribute generally performs better than the static system. © 2013 International Information Institute.},

abstract={In the last decade, many security solutions have been proposed to fulfil the security requirements of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, these solutions are specifically designed for particular security issues, based on different assumptions, and limited to certain WSNs applications. Can these security solutions work together to handle multiple problems at the same time? It is an interesting and difficult question. We believe good solutions in various security areas do not mean they can work together and deliver similar results, i.e. occurrence of any security weakness or attack in a particular security solution could expose the vulnerabilities of other solutions. Using these solutions together might also degrade WSN quality of service. To deal with the aforementioned issues, we therefore propose a novel component-based security system (COMSEC) based on proactive and reactive components. Each component looks after a particular security issue and is integrated with others. The proposed system provides better secure communication, Sybil attack detection, secure data aggregation and resilience against node capture attacks and replication attacks. COMSEC has been evaluated and compared against existing schemes. Evaluation results show a significant improvement in resilience against node capture attacks, Sybil attack detection data confidentiality, privacy, memory overhead and connectivity. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Compared with current smart spaces systems (like smart home, and smart office), SmartShadow is quite special. Firstly, unlike a room, it is a highly mobile space. Secondly, it requires frequent information exchange with the outer environment; for instance, it may need local information and other local services. The complexity of SmartShadow needs a software infrastructure of high adaptation to meet complex and easily variational situations. This chapter proposes a semantic and adaptive middleware platform, i.e., ScudWare, for SmartShadowd. In ScudWare, techniques of multi-agent, context-aware and adaptive component management are smoothly synthesized. It consists of three key components: (1) semantic virtual agents; (2) a semantic context management service; and (3) an adaptive component management service. This enables entities in SmartShadow to interact autonomously, provide semantic-integration context awareness, and support component-based adaptability and scalability. © 2013, Zhejiang University Press, Hangzhou and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={With wireless sensor networks (WSN) now readily available and capable of monitoring multiple physical phenomena over time, large volumes of data can now easily be generated in the form of multiple co-evolving data streams. This presents a number of challenging tasks for the analyst, who often seeks to monitor such data in real-time for the purposes of summarisation, anomaly detection and prediction. WSNs often suffer from severe resource constraints that prevent them from applying computational algorithms on large datasets as in conventional systems. Sensomax is an agent-based and object-oriented WSN middleware, which is capable of executing multiple concurrent applications based on their required operational paradigm. Its component-based architecture features seamless integration of light-weight computational algorithms at different levels throughout the network. This paper presents the preliminary work on a novel algorithm capable of detecting significant change points, or "points of interest" in an unsupervised fashion across multiple data streams in parallel. The algorithm is based on an incremental dimensionality reduction approach known as subspace tracking. Sensomax exploits this algorithm to detect the change points and dynamically respond to the applications' demands whilst executing concurrent applications, switching operational paradigms and reorganising at cluster and network levels. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The available state-based and path-based reliability models for the component-based software consume high computational cost and suffer from the evaluating complexity in the software evaluation. A SVM reliability evaluation model for component-based software systems (SVMREM) with a low complexity is presented in this paper. The component reliability SVM is performed to optimize the reliability evaluation time consumption. SVMREM has a low evaluation complexity and outperforms the state-based model and the path-based model of the reliability evaluation. Another advantage of SVMREM over the others is its software structure robustness. SVMREM only depends on the component historical reliabilities, which are independent from the software system structure. Based on the theory analysis and experiment results, it shows that the SVMREM reliability evaluating accuracy is acceptable when the software system structure is complex and the complexity of SVMREM is evidently lower than the contrast models. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Existing methods for detection and tracking of mobile nodes and objects via sensor networks depend on physical localization of sensor nodes. Consequently, they suffer from disadvantages associated with localization, which is often costly, error prone, and in some cases even infeasible. Tracking mobile nodes in a topological coordinate domain is proposed as an alternative to that in geographic coordinate domain. Topological coordinates (TCs), the basis of recent developments in Topology Preserving Maps (TPMs), are derived from hop distances from each node to a small subset of nodes. A technique is presented to reduce the distortion closer to the edges of principal component based TPMs, thereby enhancing its accuracy, which in turn facilitates accurate mobility tracking. Topological Coordinate based Tracking and Prediction (TCTP) algorithm is proposed for tracking and predicting the position of mobile nodes in the TC domain. Simulation results presented show that tracking and detecting performance of TCTP is competitive with geographic coordinate based algorithms despite the fact that it relies only on hop distances to a subset of nodes. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Some of the recent attempts for improving and transforming engineering education are reviewed. The attempts aim at providing the entry level engineers with the skills needed to address the challenges of future large-scale complex systems and projects. Some of the frontier sectors and future challenges for engineers are outlined. The major characteristics of the coming intelligence convergence era (the post-information age) are identified. These include the prevalence of smart devices and environments, the widespread applications of anticipatory computing and predictive / prescriptive analytics, as well as a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines. Devices and machines will be able to learn from, and with, humans in a natural collaborative way. The recent game changers in learnscapes (learning paradigms, technologies, platforms, spaces, and environments) that can significantly impact engineering education in the coming era are identified. Among these are open educational resources, knowledge-rich classrooms, immersive interactive 3D learning, augmented reality, reverse instruction / flipped classroom, gamification, robots in the classroom, and adaptive personalized learning. Significant transformative changes in, and mass customization of, learning are envisioned to emerge from the synergistic combination of the game changers and other technologies. The realization of the aforementioned vision requires the development of a new multidisciplinary framework of emergent engineering for relating innovation, complexity and cybernetics, within the future learning environments. The framework can be used to treat engineering education as a complex adaptive system, with dynamically interacting and communicating components (instructors, individual, small, and large groups of learners). The emergent behavior resulting from the interactions can produce progressively better, and continuously improving, learning environment. As a first step towards the realization of the vision, intelligent adaptive cyber-physical ecosystems need to be developed to facilitate collaboration between the various stakeholders of engineering education, and to accelerate the development of a skilled engineering workforce. The major components of the ecosystems include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities, blended learning and research spaces, novel ultra- intelligent software agents, multimodal and autonomous interfaces, and networked cognitive and tele-presence robots. © Versita sp. z o.o.},

funding_text 1={Smart grids are digital networks that use information and communication technologies, in automated ways, to improve the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity. Ideally, smart grids are also intended to work with multiple power sources, including wind and solar sources, and perhaps eventually small individual sources and ones that provide automotive power. New energy sources can be integrated into a smart grid at different times as well (see, for example [12, 13] and Figure 1). Because of the complexity of the grid, and the need to ensure stability over a wide range of operating conditions, some recent work has been devoted to future intelligent power grids, wherein neurobiology is combined with engineering to develop brain-like approaches for adaptive op- timal control of very large grids. A multidisciplinary team from Clemson University, Georgia Tech, and Missouri S and T is working on the project, which is called Brain2Grid (http://brain2grid.com/), and is sponsored by the Office of the Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) of the US National Science Foundation. The integrated sensing, communications and control of the power grid can transform the modernized end-to-end electric power system into a "smart grid" - an integrated, self-healing and electronically controlled secure and resilient power system. By knowing how failures occur, assessing vulnerabilities and working out self-healing strategies, a holistic risk management, monitoring and control system can be designed and deployed. Application of smart grid concepts to water distribution and management is described in [14]. Interdependent networks of fuel/water supply, end-to-end electric power systems, telecommunications and financial networked systems have a normal, undisturbed state and an alert model that senses precursors to an emergency state. When they are in an aggravated state they attempt to restore to a normal one. The key is to build systems that are simple and smart, that focus on reliability, robustness, efficiency and security.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are approaching an operational stalemate. While sheer emphasis on energy efficiency and resilience aid network longevity, WSNs face many hindering design principals. Prominently, an application-oriented view that isolates WSNs from ubiquitous networks, and nodes with static hardware and functional goals. We present a novel paradigm in the design of WSNs. Our goal is to achieve a resilient architecture that decouples operational mandates from the nodes. We present wirelessly interfaced components, which introduce functionality physically decoupled from the sensing nodes; boosting resilience, dynamicity and resource utilization. This approach dissects the study of nodal capacity to its 'connected' components. It also enables re-introducing only the components required to suffice for network operation. More importantly, critical resources in the network will be shared within their neighborhoods. Thus network lifetime will relate to functional cliques of dynamic nodes. We present our paradigms with insights into application and design novelty. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Traffic congestion presents significant environmental, social and economic costs. Encouraging people to cycle and use other forms of alternate transportation is one important aspect of addressing these problems. However, many city councils face significant difficulties in educating citizens and encouraging them to form new habits around these alternate forms of transport. Mobile devices present a great opportunity to effect such positive behavior change. In this paper we discuss the results of a survey aimed at understanding how mobile devices can be used to encourage cycling and/or improve the cycling experience. We use the results of the survey to design and develop a mobile app called SocialCycle, which purpose is to encourage users to start cycling and to increase the number of trips that existing riders take by bicycle. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The vision of a multitude of heterogeneous, connected devices interacting with parts of its physical environment, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has gained momentum over the last years. For traditional business information systems the integration of the IoT leads to the emergence of new value-added business processes that make use of its representative devices such as RFID, sensors and actuators, as entirely new resources. One promising approach in the IoT domain is a real-world service integration method based on Representational State Transfer (REST) principles expedited by the initiative Web of Things (WoT). The connection of classical Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems commonly based on service oriented architectures coming with heavy-weight services and the resource oriented WoT coming with RESTful services for its limited devices is still a complex problem on both sides. In this paper, we propose a bi-directional integration approach of current Business Process Management (BPM)-based ERP systems and the WoT to provide a foundation to connect and analyze legacy systems as well as Future Internet applications. By following a three phase BPM-lifecycle, we investigate how the process metamodel of the industry standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) can cover WoT specific components. Reversely, we examine how existing and useful business process information can be seamlessly included into the WoT respecting its essential architecture and applying a component-based approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={Smart environments such as smart offices are multi-user, heterogeneous and dynamic. Dynamism arises because each user is likely to have different application requirements and both users and devices may join and leave the system at runtime. Heterogeneity arises from the combined use of embedded sensor nodes, smartphones and powerful servers. The Loosely-coupled Component Infrastructure (LooCI) is a reconfigurable component and binding model that provides a consistent programming and reconfiguration approach for heterogeneous platforms. This paper outlines a demonstration that illustrates how one can build complex pervasive applications in a consistent and straight forward manner across heterogeneous platforms using LooCI. © 2012 Authors.},

abstract={Next generation sensing applications will be large-scale with multiple human actors, including: administrators, application developers, participatory sensing volunteers and consumers of sensor data. In these sensing scenarios, both human actors and software artefacts should be reconfigurable at runtime. A middleware solution for this class of sensing application should provide a relationship amongst equals, wherein human actors and software artefacts may be explicitly configured and reconfigured using a single consistent development model. In recent years, Online Social Networks have proven to be a successful and popular mechanism through which millions of people have created digital representations of themselves and their relationships. We combine a reconfigurable component model with online social networks to create a middleware that allows software and human actors to be composed into reconfigurable distributed applications. This allows developers to create dynamic sensing applications with the human explicitly in the loop. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Recent studies show that Information Centric is one of the best ways to help Internet users find useful messages among a myriad of information. With the help of a publisher/subscriber structure, users could use this Information Centric System to subscribe to messages they have interest or from the ones their friends have recommended. However, with the increasing usage of smart phones and computers, one user could need several IP addresses and the scale of the network could increase dramatically. How to guarantee that a publisher/subscriber structure based system continues to work well becomes an important problem. This paper provides a suitable way of checking the configuration of a publisher/subscriber system network by using Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) and Computation Tree Logic (CTL). In order to apply this kind of model checking methods to a large network, a necessary model checking code generator is provided in this paper. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Component-based architectures can play an important role in solving some of the problems related to energy management in Wireless Sensor Networks. It has been recently shown that real-time interfaces, and their associated mechanisms for online adaptation, are useful for solving the problem of dynamically allocating bandwidth in a WSN, while still satisfying both quality and energy constraints. In this paper we will discuss the relevance of extending this model with a new parameter, the transmission power of the nodes. Based on experimental data, it will be shown that this parameter has a strong impact on both the energy consumed by the nodes and the quality/reliability of the communication. The integration of this feature with the notion real-time interface, although not completely solved, will be discussed as well. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A major issue when developing Wireless sensor networks applications is the need for highly specialized knowledge in the field of embedded programming, networking and in the application domain. In order to speed up the development process, a new methodology for WSN application development is required. It needs to provide ready to use building blocks as well as means to map application requirements to technical features provided by these blocks. Last but not least, mechanisms to select appropriate building blocks and to evaluate the system compiled out of these blocks are essentially needed. This paper presents a design flow fulfilling the mentioned features. In a first step, user requirements elicited from a managed catalog are translated to a graph structure. Then, properties of the composed system derived from meta-information of the applied components are evaluated to resolve constraints -representing application requirements and/or features of the target system- in the derived system model. The validity of the methodology, for which the needed tool support has actually been implemented, is shown in an example that illustrates how this approach can propose correct configurations for secure systems as proposed in related work. Since the approach allows designing correct and fine-tuned solutions even for general application requirements we consider it to be a significant step towards improved programmability of WSN nodes. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks are characterized by a large number of non-standardized protocols and varying application requirements. This creates need for a systematic approach to rapidly design and optimize deployment specific protocol stacks. We employ component based optimization as a candidate solution, and use it as a basis for an extensible software framework called CONFab. We treat a particular protocol stack as a collection of interdependent configurable components. CONFab captures a deployment scenario description, relates it to the desired performance metrics, and correspondingly suggests suitable protocol stacks and parameter settings. It utilizes ontology centric knowledge base to select components from a pool of alternatives, reason on their compatibility and, thus create appropriate protocol stacks. The framework is equipped with a number of additional plugins that allow, for instance, to incorporate feedback from deployed systems and user inputs to anticipate network performance. We use a set of wellknownMAC and routing protocols to validate the framework on the Indriya testbed in different user specified application and deployment conditions.

abstract={Despite the promising vision of pervasive sensor networks of thousands of nodes, conducting such large-scale experiments on demand is still far from reality due to the limitations of resources, space, and maintenance. To address such challenges, we propose the MagicLink middleware to "magically" weave geographically distributed sensor networks into a large-scale sensor network testbed. MagicLink is a key part of the OKGems remotely programmable cyber-physical system project under the GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovation) initiative; and MagicLink is designed to enable shared "clouds" of sensors for sensor network research and experiments at scale and on demand. Specifically, MagicLink has the following salient features: (1) seamless integration of multi-site sensor networks offering elastic and scalable testbeds; (2) online adaptive simulation that adopts a realistic radio model making the cross-site Internet connection behave like a one-hop sensor network link in real environment; (3) component-based design allowing easy integration with user applications. To the best of our knowledge, MagicLink is the first solution to enable "almost-real" large-scale sensor network experiments across sites. In this paper, we present MagicLink's system architecture and subsystem design. We demonstrate the usability and fidelity of MagicLink through experimental results with representative applications on a two-site testbed. © 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of computational and physical components, which includes various types of physical phenomena such as electrical and mechanical domains. Many modeling paradigms exist to model the static properties and dynamic behavior of such components. However, there is no unified modeling framework to compose components that use different paradigms and/or tools. In this paper, we present the syntax and semantics of such an integration language and its component-based design, where components can embed models from different tools, formalisms, and paradigms such as Bond Graphs and Modelica models. Our framework is built around common set of interface concepts to support heterogeneous composition and interchangeability among modeling paradigms. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and control with sensing and actuation of the physical environment. Typically, such systems consist of embedded computers that monitor and control physical processes in a feedback loop. While modern electronic systems are increasingly characterized as CPS, their design and synthesis still rely on traditional methods, which lack systematic and automated techniques for accomplishment. Recently, IEC 61499 has been proposed as a standard for designing industrial process-control and measurement systems. It prescribes a component-based approach for developing industrial automation software using function blocks. Executable code can then be automatically generated and simulated from these function blocks. This bodes well for designers of CPS, who are more likely to be experts in specific industrial domains, rather than in computer science. The intuitive graphical nature and automatic code synthesis of IEC 61499 programs will alleviate the programming burden of industrial engineers, while ensuring more reliable software. While software synthesis from IEC 61499 programs is not new, the generation of efficient code from them has been wanting. This has made it difficult for function blocks to be used in software development for resource-constrained embedded controllers commonly employed in CPS. To address this, we present an approach that can generate very efficient code from function block descriptions. Experimental results from a benchmark suite shows that our approach produces substantially faster and smaller code compared to existing techniques. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Component Based Software Engineering has achieved notable success in supporting the development of wireless sensor network applications. However, contemporary component models provide poor support for modeling distributed interactions: either relying on inappropriate communication primitives or providing no support for distribution. This paper argues that providing support for distribution is a critical requirement for wireless sensor network component models. To address this concern, we contribute a novel event-based binding mechanism and supporting network framework that allows for easy application composition and reconfiguration. We evaluate the proposed binding model and demonstrate that it is a good fit with the requirements of wireless sensor network applications while being sufficiently compact for embedded mote platforms. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Full data coverage of urban environments is crucial to monitor the status of the area to detect, for instance, trends and detrimental environmental changes. Collecting observations related to environmental factors such as noise pollution in urban environments through classical approaches implies the deployment of Sensor Networks. The cost of deployment and maintenance of such infrastructure might be relatively high for local and regional governments. On the other hand recent mass-market mobile devices such as smartphones are full of sensors. For instance, it is possible to perform measurements of noise through its microphone. Therefore they become low-cost measuring devices that many citizens have in their pocket. In this paper we present an approach for gathering noise pollution data by using mobile applications. The applications are designed following gamification techniques to encourage users to participate using their personal smartphones. In this way the users are involved in taking and sharing noise pollution measurements in their cities that other stakeholders can use in their analysis and decision making processes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Nowadays, more and more developments in the embedded systems domain are based on components and abstract models. However, while the design becomes more abstract, control and monitoring during runtime are often performed on low abstraction levels. In contrast to this low level access we present a seamless design flow for adjustment and error identification using abstract component-based models. We develop an extended metamodel to describe components and their platforms and the connection between the model and the real hardware. Furthermore, we integrate on model level platform abilities for control and especially debugging to support for example real-time recording. From a user's perspective the system is designed, controlled and monitored on model level. We discuss different methods concerning runtime control and monitoring of resource constraint systems. We demonstrate the concept's applicability based on two exemplary use cases: wireless sensor network application engineering and reconfigurable hardware development. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSN) based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Personal Area Network (PAN) Standard and the ZigBee 2007 Standard provide a framework for component-based software that supports interoperable solutions from multiple vendors. Mesh-enabled WSNs provide inherent fault tolerance and provide low-power, low-cost ancillary sensing systems for Integrated System Health Management for aerospace particularly across pressure interfaces and in areas where it is difficult to run wires. Intelligence for sensor networks could be defined as the capability of forming self-managing dynamic sensor networks, allowing high-level application software to identify a module and interpret sensor values without using a pre-defined configuration database. Self-configuring system architectures for wireless sensor networks can support a large number of sensors in a dynamic configuration, providing intelligent response for fault tolerant networks. The IEEE 1451 Smart Transducer Interface Standard defines Transducer Electronic Datasheets (TEDS) containing key information regarding sensor characteristics such as name, description, serial number and calibration information. By locating this TEDS meta-information on the wireless sensor itself and enabling access to this information from the application software directly, the application can identify the sensor unambiguously and present the sensor data stream through network and module discovery. An interesting method for implementing the IEEE 1451 standard, based on the Air Force Research Lab's Space Plug-and-Play Avionics (SPA) approach may simplify application software development compatible with modern software standards. The emerging AIAA SPA Standards can simplify adoption by standardizing application software interfaces and development by the use of the xTEDS based on Extensible Markup Language to provide sensor and actuator object virtualization within a standard framework. The authors propose an integration of ZigBee, IEEE 1451 and SPA to further define a facile software framework and the paper outlines the general architecture and approach for implementation of a prototype. The technical feasibility of creating fault-tolerant WSNs for Structural Health Monitoring is presented as a relevant example applied to composite structures for wind tunnel and flight tests to facilitate understanding key aspects of the aerospace vehicle design, test and operations life cycle.},

abstract={The complexity of modern embedded systems increases as they incorporate new concerns such as distribution and mobility. These new features need to be considered as early as possible in the software development life cycle. Model driven engineering promotes an intensive use of models and is now widely seen as a solution to master the development of complex systems such as embedded ones. Component-based software engineering is another major trend that gains acceptance in the embedded world because of its properties such as reuse, modularity, and flexibility. This article proposes the Flex-eWare component model (FCM) for designing and implementing modern embedded systems. The FCM unifies model driven engineering and component-based software engineering and has been evaluated in several application domains with different requirements: wireless sensor networks, distributed client/server applications, and control systems for electrical devices. This approach highlights a new concept: flexibility points that arise at several stages of the development process, that is, in the model (design phase), in the execution platform, and during the execution itself. This flexibility points are captured with model libraries that can extend the FCM. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Creating and managing applications for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is complicated by large scale, resource constraints and network dynamics. Reconfigurable component models minimize these complexities throughout the application lifecycle. However, contemporary component based middleware for WSNs is limited by its poor support for distribution. This paper introduces the Loosely-coupled Component Infrastructure (LooCI), a middleware for building distributed component-based WSN applications. LooCI advances the state-of-the-art by cleanly separating distributed concerns from component implementation, supporting application-level interoperability between heterogeneous WSN platforms and providing compatibility testing of bindings at runtime. Together, these features promote the safe and efficient composition and reconfiguration of distributed WSN applications. We evaluate the performance of LooCI on three classes of sensor nodes and demonstrate that these features can be provided with minimal overhead in terms of computation, memory and message passing. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a wide range of potential applications for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), each one with different features and requirements and defining a different mission for the sensor nodes to accomplish. In order to achieve the best network performance, it is important to adapt the network operation to these different missions. Such adaptation should be preferably performed by a middleware layer that translates application missions to networks configuration in a transparent way for the final users and client applications. In this context, we propose MARINE (MiddlewAre for Resource and mIssion oriented sensor NEtworks), a WSN middleware that tailors the WSN to requirements of each application mission while optimizing the overall resource consumption in sensor nodes.

abstract={With the development and popularity of the approach of CBSD (Component-based Software Development), the number of reusable software component keeps on increasing. To evaluate the component quality objectively has become the key issue in CBSD applications. The current component quality models only focus on some types of components and usually are applicable to some kinds of users. This paper proposes a component quality model based on ISO/IEC 9126 standard, which combines the features of black box and white box component. The component quality model aims at component developer, reuser and the third party. It can provide feasible reference for component evaluation. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With this paper we offer an insight in designing and analyzing wireless sensor networks in a versatile manner. Our framework applies probabilistic and component-based design principles for the wireless sensor network modeling and consequently analysis; while maintaining flexibility and accuracy. In particular, we address the problem of allocating and reconfiguring the available bandwidth. The framework has been successfully implemented in IEEE 802.15.4 using an Admission Control Manager (ACM); which is a module of the MAC layer that guarantees that the nodes respect their probabilistic bandwidth assignment as well as the bandwidth assignment policy applied. The proposed framework also aims to accurately analyze the behaviors of communication protocols for energy-consumption and reliability purposes. We evaluate the probabilistic bandwidth assignment methods using CSMA/CA access protocol of IEEE 802.15.4. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the ACM and compare the performance of the network using the ACM against the original standard. The simulation results show that the use of ACM increases the overall performance of the network. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Home automation is gaining popularity nowadays. A smart home automation system is based on ensuring security and making user life easier. It contains a large number of sensors which can control or monitor objects distributed in three-dimensional space. The sensors can be specialized in measuring temperature, humidity, pressure, light, noise, dust air, and so on. In this paper, a solution to transform a normal house in a smart house while reducing the energy consumption is proposed. This can be realized with the help of wireless sensor networks and of the LabVIEW™ graphical programming environment, which use the NI LabVIEW™ Statechart Module for collecting data from sensors. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, there has been considerable research on using mobility in wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs) to assist in the deployment of nodes and meet the sensing, communication, and actuation coverage requirements. One of the well-know simulators used to evaluate the performance of wireless sensor networks is TOSSIM. It has the advantage that its code can also run in real systems, and hence it allows better comparison between experimental and simulation results. However, it is designed to simulate only static sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a classification scheme that categorizes the mobility models in WSANs. Based on this classification, we design and implement MOB-TOSSIM, the first extension framework to TOSSIM that supports mobility in WSNs and WSANs. MOB-TOSSIM implements three components: (1) a set of probabilistic and controlled mobility models, (2) an extended and modified version of Power TOSSIM that includes the energy consumption due to mobility and radio transmission, and (3) a radio component based on a realistic propagation model. Experiment results show that MOB-TOSSIM is scalable with respect to network size and node speed, as it incurs an acceptable additional execution time compared to TOSSIM. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) offer new ways for people to interact with computing systems: every thing now integrates computing power that can be leveraged to provide safety, assistance, guidance or simply comfort to users. CPS are long living and pervasive systems that intensively rely on microcontrollers and low power CPUs, integrated into buildings (e.g. automation to improve comfort and energy optimization) or cars (e.g. advanced safety features involving car-to-car communication to avoid collisions). CPS operate in volatile environments where nodes should cooperate in opportunistic ways and dynamically adapt to their context. This paper presents μ-Kevoree, the projection of Kevoree (a component model based on models@runtime) to microcontrollers. μ-Kevoree pushes dynamicity and elasticity concerns directly into resource-constrained devices. Its evaluation regarding key criteria in the embedded domain (memory usage, reliability and performance) shows that, despite a contained overhead, μ-Kevoree provides the advantages of a dynamically reconfigurable component-based model (safe, fine-grained, and efficient reconfiguration) compared to traditional techniques for dynamic firmware upgrades.

abstract={To support the programming of Wireless Sensor Networks, a number of unconventional programming models have evolved, in particular the event-based model. These models are non-intuitive to programmers due to the introduction of unnecessary, non-intrinsic complexity. Component-based languages like Insense can eliminate much of this unnecessary complexity via the use of active components and synchronous channels. However, simply layering an Insense implementation over an existing event-based system, like TinyOS, while proving efficacy, is insufficiently space and time efficient for production use. The design and implementation of a new language-specific OS, InceOS, enables both space and time efficient programming of sensor networks using component-based languages like Insense.},

abstract={In the simple devices used for wireless sensor networks, the costs associated with a layered approach can be significant. Small-footprint operating systems have been developed by adopting non-traditional approaches to network abstractions while still aiming to simplify software development. In these approaches, some elements of modularity are valuable to retain, e.g., packet buffer management, which can be factored out of the layers and supported by a generic interface. In this paper, we describe the PicOS operating system with its versatile network interface (VNETI) and describe our experience using it. VNETI's approach to the problem, where it acts as a mediator between (a) the application programming interface, (b) protocol plug-ins, and (c) a physical input/output module, allows for an effective component-based design with low overheads. With our essentially layer-less approach to networking, we have found it intuitive to incorporate even the simplest devices into nontrivial networks.},

abstract={Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) are used for diverse applications ranging from monitoring for medical purposes, sport coaching to computer gaming. This leads to viewing the BSN as an application platform and requires the capability to dynamically extend and configure BSN applications, including reprogramming the sensor nodes of the BSN. We propose a trust management model along with a component-based architecture to maintain the BSN as trustworthy platform under such changes in applications. With this model the trustworthiness can be autonomically evaluated and monitored at component, application, and system levels with respect to properties of security, dependability, and performance. The usage of the model is shown with an example of an ECG monitoring application. Copyright © 2012 ICST.},

abstract={The complexity of software in safety critical systems has increased significantly over the last ten years so that how to tackle the complexity and gain high dependable software plays an important roles in ensuring the overall product quality. In this context, component based development (CBD) has been successfully applied to large scale software system in the fields of Software Engineering. Similarly, System Safety Analysis (SSA) has also gained wide used in critical systems in the fields of System Safety Engineering. But they often used their methodology in isolation. Furthermore, shortage of unified formal framework to bridge the gap between the CBD and SSA make it hard to integrate them into a unified rigorous development process for safety critical systems. This paper describes a new approach called Component Fault Tree and Fault Tolerant pattern guided Fault Tolerant Software Architecture (CFT3SA), which bridge the gap between CBD and SSA to realize the seamless integration of CBD and SSA. Furthermore, the formal definitions of Component Fault Tree, Fault tolerant Pattern underpin the systematical verification and validation of fault tolerant systems. A case study from the Odemetry Safe System in the train control domain has been used to valuate the feasibility of the proposed fault tolerant software architectural solution. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={ThetextitService Component Architecture (SCA) is a technology-independent standard for developing distributed Service-oriented Architectures (SOA). The SCA standard promotes the use of components and architecture descriptors, and mostly covers the lifecycle steps of implementation and deployment. Unfortunately, SCA does not address the governance of SCA applications and provides no support for the maintenance of deployed components. This article covers this issue and introduces the FRASCATI platform, a run-time support for SCA with dynamic reconfiguration capabilities and run-time management features. This article presents the internal component-based architecture of the FRASCATI platform, and highlights its key features. The component-based design of the FRASCATI platform introduces many degrees of flexibility and configurability in the platform itself and it can host the SOA applications. This article reports on micro-benchmarks highlighting that run-time manageability in the FRASCATI platform does not decrease its performance when compared with the de facto reference SCA implementation: Apache TUSCANY. Finally, a smart home scenario illustrates the extension capabilities and the various reconfigurations of the FRASCATI platform. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract={Aiming at the failure of components problem in device service networks of internet of things, reliability of components was analyzed theoretically. Component-based migration maintenance strategy was proposed which analyzed link probability and degree of components migration, a components migration three-tier framework based on CM-ECA rule was proposed according to the process of dynamic migration of components which includes components migration in layer, components migration path layer, components migration out layer. The role of the CM-ECA rules in those three-tiered makes components migration and replacement time meet the deadline time for service completion, components migration path layer uses game-theoretic selection scheme. The experiments results show that the migration maintenance strategy make migration load tradeoff and components to be migrated and replaced within the deadline time. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Faulty components in a network need to be localized and repaired to sustain the health of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that carefully combines active and passive measurements to localize faults in wireless sensor networks. More specifically, we formulate a problem of optimal sequential testing guided by end-to-end data. This problem determines an optimal testing sequence of network components based on end-to-end data in sensor networks to minimize expected testing cost. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, and propose a recursive approach to solve it. This approach leads to a polynomial-time optimal algorithm for line topologies while requiring exponential running time for general topologies. We further develop two polynomial-time heuristic schemes that are applicable to general topologies. Extensive simulation shows that our heuristic schemes only require testing a very small set of network components to localize and repair all faults in the network. Our approach is superior to using active and passive measurements in isolation. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches that localize and repair all faults in a network. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider various problems concerning quasi-matchings and semi-matchings in bipartite graphs, which generalize the classical problem of determining a perfect matching in bipartite graphs. We prove a generalization of Hall's marriage theorem, and present an algorithm that solves the problem of determining a lexicographically minimum g-quasi-matching (that is a set F of edges in a bipartite graph such that in one set of the bipartition every vertex v has at least g(v) incident edges from F, where g is a so-called need mapping, while on the other side of the bipartition the distribution of degrees with respect to F is lexicographically minimum). We obtain that finding a lexicographically minimum quasi-matching is equivalent to minimizing any strictly convex function on the degrees of the A-side of a quasi-matching and use this fact to prove a more general statement: the optima of any component-based strictly convex cost function on any subset of L 1-sphere in ℕ n are precisely the lexicographically minimal elements of this subset. We also present an application in designing optimal CDMA-based wireless sensor networks. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We focus on energy efficiency, which guarantees the operation of a Wireless Sensor Network for long. We propose a context compression model that works in an orthogonal fashion. We first reduce the dimensions of multivariate contextual information. This is achieved through the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which determines the statistical dependencies between the different contextual components. We then suppress the transmission of the determined principal components through an extrapolation scheme that exploits the properties of each individual component. Our findings are quite promising for the broader domain of WSN-based application engineering and context awareness. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are hybrid, component-based and open systems. Hybrid interface automata (HIA), which extend from interface automata, are introduced to model CPS. HIA are not input-enable, that is, only certain inputs can be accepted on a location of HIA. Thus, HIA can specify assumptions about the environment made by a component. HIA use an optimistic approach to composition, that is, two components are compatible if there is an environment in which they can work together. It is the important that HIA can describe the continuous behavior as well as the discrete behavior of a system. We give the algorithms for bounded checking the reach ability, well-formedness and compatibility of CPS. Technically, a bounded model checking on HIA is encoded as a dynamic programming. The algorithms for reach ability, well-formedness and compatibility checking are thus derived from genetic algorithms for solving dynamic programming. In comparison with the traditional algorithms in the theory of hybrid automata, which generally require that the model is linear, our algorithms relax the restriction. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Component-based models are very useful for the design of reliable systems. In this paper we focus on properties sensitive to the availability of components (e.g. sensors or actuators). To evaluate the degree of fault tolerance of a given property, we propose usefulness measures of components based on the lattice of system configurations. Being quite general, the approach needs no assumption on the system. A sensor network design example for the output connection property illustrates the practical use of the proposed tools. © 2012 IFAC.},

abstract={Heterogeneity and dynamicity of pervasive environments require the construction of flexible multimodal interfaces at run time. In this paper, we present how we use an autonomic approach to build and maintain adaptable input multimodal interfaces in smart building environments. We have developed an autonomic solution relying on partial interaction models specified by interaction designers and developers. The role of the autonomic manager is to build complete interaction techniques based on runtime conditions and in conformity with the predicted models. The sole purpose here is to combine and complete partial models in order to obtain an appropriate multimodal interface. We illustrate our autonomic solution by considering a running example based on an existing application and several input devices. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={This paper provides a summary of ongoing research sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that seeks to improve inspection practices for steel bridges by providing the technology and methodology for realtime monitoring. In order to reduce the time and cost of installing a traditional monitoring system, the research team is investigating the use of wireless communications within the sensor network. To date, the research has included the investigation of both IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 wireless communications, identifying the latter as more practical for bridge monitoring applications. Studies were conducted to characterize the performance of wireless communications in various bridge types. The paper also describes the development of a low-power wireless strain data acquisition device. The intended bridge monitoring requires the continuous, nonstop and reliable capture of live load data, while minimizing power consumption. An intelligent wireless sensor node that can be programmed, using LabVIEW graphical programming technology, to process and reduce the strain data in realtime has been prototyped and is being tested on a highway bridge in Austin, TX. The engineering challenges faced in trading off power consumption with performance for strain gage measurements is discussed.},

abstract={A software component is defined as a unit of composition with contractually specified interfaces and explicit dependencies that may be independently deployed. Components form generic, re-usable software building blocks, which can be composed into applications and deployed by third parties. A good component model therefore must seek to minimize implicit dependencies in order to maximize re-use and composability. The benefits of component models have led to their widespread application in the area of networked embedded systems and particularly Wireless Sensor Networks. This paper first classifies and analyses the types of dependency that a component may be subject to. Next, we assess the success of contemporary component models in eliminating implicit dependencies and promoting re-usability. We then describe our efforts to reduce implicit distributed dependencies in the design of LooCI: the Loosely-coupled Component Infrastructure. We conclude with a call-to-arms for the component-based software engineering community that suggests avenues for future work. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This contribution introduces an emergency management system design based on platform-independent multi-touch technology as an interactive, ubiquitous front-end technology for pervasive sensor and communication components. This combination aims at supporting decision making and analyses during all phases of the emergency management process. From stakeholders providing planning information beforehand to end users communicating via their mobile phones or even distributed sensor networks, the system taps into a wide range of data sources and offers a comprehensive, digestible view on the data using multi-touch surfaces in the operations centre. In order to integrate legacy data sources and to keep the system open for the integration of additional data sources in the future, a model based approach is used. Demonstration versions of the system's components based on current multi-touch frameworks and hardware as well as mobile apps and communities are also presented.},

abstract={The emerging reality of wireless sensor networks deployed as long-lived infrastructure mandates an approach to tailor developed artefacts at run-time to avoid costly reprogramming. Support for dynamic concerns, such as adaptation, calibration or tuning of the functional and non-functional behaviour by application users and infrastructure managers raises the need for fine-grained run-time customization. This paper presents a policy-based paradigm to realize the diverse concerns of the involved actors by enabling fine-tuning and optimization of the run-time environment. Integration of the policy paradigm into various main programming models is analyzed. A prototype implementation of the paradigm in the context of an event-component based wireless sensor network platform is evaluated on the SunSPOT sensor platform. © 2011 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={In this paper, we concentrate on automated synthesis of fault recovery mechanism for fault-intolerant component based models that encompass a cyber-physical system. We define the notion of fault recovery for cyber-physical component-based models. We also present synthesis constraints that preserve the correctness and cyber-physical nature of a given fault-intolerant model under which recovery can be added. We show that the corresponding synthesis problem is NP-complete and consequently introduce symbolic heuristics to tackle the exponential complexity. Our experimental results validate effectiveness of our heuristics for relatively large models. Copyright © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={This article firstly discusses the current situations of anti-misoperation system in power system. In order to meet the new requirements for the anti-maloperation anti-lock system in the development of new technologies and changes in the mode of management, the computer lock must have more new functions such as telemetry, remote transfer, remote control and so on, except for the original functions. In order to resolve these problems, we put forward a new design of the intelligent lock which is mainly based on the technology of wireless sensor network. Finally, we give the circuit diagram of the hardware components based on FREESCALE single chip and describe how to design the software. This type of intelligent lock could meet the new requirements for the anti-maloperation anti-lock system of the new operating mode. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Within smart homes, ambient sensors are used to monitor the interaction between users and the home environment. The data produced from the sensors is used as the basis for the inference of the users' behaviour information. Partitioning sensor data in response to individual instances of activity is critical for a smart home to be fully functional and to fulfil its role, such as correctly measuring health status and detecting emergency situations. In this study, we propose a multi-component based sensor segmentation approach in an effort to detect and recognise activities within a smart home. A publicly available dataset containing 1,230 sensor events generated in response to 245 instances of 7 activity classes along with 59 idle periods was used to validate the approach. Initial results of the proposed methods have been encouraging achieving 95.72%, 89.52% and 86.13% in respect to precision, recall and accuracy in detecting and recognising activities in addition to the capability of detecting interleaved activities. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Energy Consumption Interaction Automata (ECIA) is presented to model cyber-physical systems' interaction behavior and energy consumption constraint information. The component-interaction automata is an excellent model for specifying architecture and behavior information, but fails to depict energy consumption constraint information in cyber-physical systems. ECIA extends the description ability of component interaction automata by binding each action with an energy consumption interval. ECIA models of cyber-physical systems can be composed together based on the ECIA composition definition we presented in this paper. Applications of ECIA, such as specifying and verifying components' interaction properties in the design stage of developing component-based cyber-physical systems, are discussed. An example is given to demonstrate how ECIA can be used to analyze the energy-related properties of components' behavior in cyber-physical systems. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Modular software, in which strongly-separated units of functionality can be independently added to and removed from a node's running software, offers a promising approach to effective dynamic software updating in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Modular software updating approaches offer high efficiency, in terms of both network costs and update installation at nodes, as well as low disruption, allowing existing software to continue to operate during updates. Existing approaches however critically lack safety, relying on weakly-typed event-based programming abstractions for inter-module interaction. This precludes compile-time or composition-time verification of interoperability between dynamically loaded modules and therefore presents major risks for future large-scale production-class deployments. In this paper we present Lorien: a component-based modular operating environment that employs interface-based inter-component interaction to support completely type-safe software composition, while still supporting high update efficiency and low disruption. Our approach also has very wide scope, allowing almost 90% of software to be remotely updated on common sensor platforms such as the TelosB. We compare Lorien against existing modular designs, finding that the safety properties of Lorien are offered with near equal efficiency. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being extensively deployed today in various monitoring and control applications by enabling rapid deployments at low cost and with high flexibility. However, high-level software development is still one of the major challenges to wide-spread WSN adoption. The success of high-level programming approaches in WSNs is heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, code well-structuring, degree of code reusability, required software development effort and the ability to tune the sensor software for a particular application. Component-based programming has been recognized as an effective approach to satisfy such requirements. However, most of the componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to various reasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In this article, we present Remora, a novel component-based approach to overcome the hurdles of WSN software implementation and configuration. Remora offers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well with resource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore, the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposal more practical for embedded applications, which are inherently event-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora and underlying system software promises a new direction towards separation of concerns in WSNs. This feature also offers a practical way to develop sensor middleware services which should be generic and developed close to the operating system. Additionally, it allows the customization of sensor software-deploying only application-required system-level services on nodes, instead of installing a fixed large system software image for any application. Our evaluation results show that the deployed Remora applications have an acceptable memory overhead and a negligible CPU cost compared with the state-of-the-art development models. © 2011 The Author.},

abstract={Separation of concerns is an important aspect of component-based development (CBD), and managing data is a primary concern in enterprise systems. In CBD methods, such as Catalysis and UML components, this concern is addressed by business components. Although a business component is self-contained, having no direct dependency on any of the other components, the data propagation between components may lead to indirect data dependencies across the business components, and grasping such dependencies at design-time is crucial to maintaining data consistency. In this paper we propose a method for data-flow analysis (DFA) of the business component model, in which the operational behavior is described using the Object Constraint Language (OCL) pre-postconditions. Traditional DFA techniques are aimed at procedural descriptions, while OCL is a declarative language whose essential properties include nondeterminism and incompleteness. In order to extract a data-flow from the OCL descriptions taking account of their semantics, our proposed method applies the idea of abstract interpretation. We also analyze the safety of our abstract interpretation technique, and discuss the usefulness and scalability of the method from a practical viewpoint. The proposed method, when used in conjunction with the inter-procedural DFA techniques, would allow us to extract the propagation and dependency of data across the business components automatically. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Design and development of wireless sensor network applications adds an additional layer of complexity to traditional computer systems. The developer needs to be an expert in resource constrained embedded devices as well as traditional desktop computers. We propose TinyInventor, an open-source development environment that takes a holistic approach to implementing sensor network applications. Users build applications using a drag-and-drop visual programming language Open Blocks, a language that Google selected for its App Inventor for Android. TinyInventor uses cross-platform programming concepts, such as threads and common network operations, to provide a unified environment from which it generates application binaries for the respective platforms. We demonstrate through an application example that TinyInventor is both simple to use and powerful in expressing complex applications. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Narrow band (NB), spread spectrum (SS), and ultra wide band (UWB) are three physical layer bandwidth types used in wireless sensor networks (WSN). SS and UWB technologies have many advantages over NB, which make them preferable for WSN. Synchronisation of different nodes in a WSN is an important task that is necessary to improve cooperation and lifetime of nodes. Code acquisition is the main step of a node's time synchronisation. In this article, a pseudo noise code generator and a code acquisition circuit are proposed, designed and tested using direct sequence SS technique. To investigate the properties of the designed circuits, simulations are carried out via Xilinx Foundation Series software in the real mode. The results demonstrate excellent performance of the proposed algorithms and circuits in all realistic conditions. The code acquisition circuit proposed an adaptive testing window for single dwell serial search method. The code acquisition circuit is a clock phase free approach, thus the clock coherency step is cancelled. Moreover, clock phase difference between transmitter and receiver nodes does not mostly affect the acquisition and thus synchronisation time. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Reliability is a key driver of safety-critical systems such as health-care systems and traffic controllers. It is also one of the most important quality attributes of the systems embedded into our surroundings, e.g. sensor networks that produce information for business processes. Therefore, the design decisions that have a great impact on the reliability of a software system, i.e. architecture and components, need to be thoroughly evaluated. This paper addresses software reliability evaluation during the design and implementation phases; it provides a coherent approach by combining both predicted and measured reliability values with heuristic estimates in order to facilitate a smooth reliability evaluation process. The approach contributes by integrating the component-level reliability evaluation activities (i.e. the heuristic reliability estimation, model-based reliability prediction and model-based reliability measuring of components) and the system-level reliability prediction activity to support the incremental and iterative development of reliable component-based software systems. The use of the developed reliability evaluation approach with the supporting tool chain is illustrated by a case study. The paper concludes with a summary of lessons learnt from the case studies. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSN) based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Personal Area Network standard are finding increasing use in the home automation and emerging smart energy markets. The network and application layers, based on the ZigBee 2007 PRO Standard, provide a convenient framework for component-based software that supports customer solutions from multiple vendors. This technology is supported by System-on-a-Chip solutions, resulting in extremely small and low-power nodes. The Wireless Connections in Space Project addresses the aerospace flight domain for both flight-critical and non-critical avionics. WSNs provide the inherent fault tolerance required for aerospace applications utilizing such technology. The team from Ames Research Center has developed techniques for assessing the fault tolerance of ZigBee WSNs challenged by radio frequency (RF) interference or WSN node failure. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In the vision of pervasive computing, technology is integrated throughout our environment. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) provide support for pervasive computing applications through integration of environmental data. We believe that previous approaches to resource management in WSNs are designed to provide support for a specific application and do not adequately support the vision of pervasive computing. A separation of concerns between application logic and resource management is needed to provide adequate support for multiple concurrent applications using the WSN infrastructure. Additionally, sensor resource management middleware should provide appropriate primitives to support the creation of self-management frameworks. These frameworks should support the sharing of sensor network resources between multiple applications and should be extensible in order to comply with changing business needs, while leveraging on the existing infrastructure. This paper presents a component-based resource management middleware architecture that is designed to support the construction of large scale, self-managing distributed systems. We will show how the proposed architecture provides resource management support for concurrent applications while promoting reusability and extensibility for both sensor network infrastructure and software services. Furthermore our approach actively promotes point of action processing, which provides significant benefits in enterprise application deployments. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={With the inclusion of actuators on wireless nodes, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are starting to change from sense-and-report platforms to sense-and-react platforms. Applications for such platforms are characterised by actuator nodes that are able to react to data collected by sensor nodes. Sensor and actuator nodes use a variety of interactions, for example, intra-node, inter-node (1-hop to n-hop), and global (all nodes). As a result, the functionality that coordinates the activities of the different nodes towards common goals has to be efficiently distributed in the WSN itself. In addition, multiple sense-and-react applications are being deployed within the same WSN, with each application characterised by different requirements and constraints. The design and implementation of these applications is becoming an increasingly complex task that would benefit from new approaches. In this article, we describe a novel middleware that separates the interaction behaviour of sense-and-react WSN applications from the components that implement the basic functionalities (sensing, reacting, computation, storage). This is achieved using policies that govern the interaction behaviour of sense-and-react WSN applications. The middleware is composed of a Policy Manager, a Publish/Subscribe Broker, and a set of Extensions that reside on each node. The broker manages subscription information, while extensions provide mechanisms orthogonal to the publish/subscribe core including diffusion protocols, data communication protocols, and data encryption. We conduct a detailed evaluation of the performance of our framework and show that the framework is close to TinyOS in performance but leads to more explicit and flexible application designs. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The diversified applications of wireless sensor networks impose different types of requirements on MAC protocols. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to be able to prototype new MAC designs efficiently. In this paper, we describe a component based framework, which enables flexible and rapid MAC designing for sensor networks. We have identified and implemented a basic component library, which serves as the basis for realizing a wide range of protocol designs. We provide an interactive graphical user interface for designing MAC protocols and a tool-chain for auto-code generation. This takes off the burden of learning programming language and platform details from the designers. Our framework facilitates fast prototyping of MAC solutions and allows reusability of existing design sessions through an interactive'drag n drop' based user friendly environment. We have carried out detailed performance comparison of widely known MAC protocols developed through our framework to their monolithic counterparts on real sensor network testbed. Our results indicate that the framework allows high degree of component reusability across different MAC implementations without compromising performance characteristics and imparting only a slight memory overhead. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper discusses the discovery mechanism of program components based on knowledge descriptions of home sensors in network middleware. Descriptions are written in Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF descriptions are easily appended to new information and connected to other knowledge. Developers and programs search appropriate program components based on knowledge such as sensor properties in the middleware. We prepared knowledge on sensor-embedded objects and constructed program components for an occupant's location estimation and a context-aware application. Experiments show the feasibility of flexible discovery for heterogeneous program components using RDF-based description.},

abstract={Localization is crucial for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. As the distance-measurement ranges are often less than the communication ranges for many ranging systems, most communication-dense wireless networks are localization-sparse. Consequently, existing algorithms fail to provide accurate localization supports. In order to address this issue, by introducing the concept of component, we group nodes into components so that nodes are able to better share ranging and anchor knowledge. Operating on the granularity of components, our design, CALL, relaxes two essential restrictions in localization: the node ordering and the anchor distribution. Compared to previous designs, CALL is proven to be able to locate the same number of nodes using the least information. We evaluate the effectiveness of CALL through extensive simulations. The results show that CALL locates 90% nodes in a network with average degree 7.5 and 5% anchors, which outperforms the state-of-the-art design Sweeps by about 40%. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Distribution has become a necessity for the majority of computing domains, but developing distributed applications remains a highly delicate and complex task. Several emerging distributed computing and application domains, including cloud computing, service-oriented computing, stream processing, sensor networks, and context-aware computing, pose unprecedented challenges to the programmer. Applications in these domains can deliver tangible benefits to the user once they enter the mainstream of industrial software development. What is hindering the wide adoption and use of these applications is the prevalence of ad-hoc programming practices in their software development process. The goal of this workshop is to explore programming support innovations that can address the incongruence between the advanced programming requirements of emerging distributed applications and the current state of the art of their programming support. To that end, the workshop will provide a venue for free and open discussions among academic researchers and industry practitioners of distributed applications.},

abstract={The rapid progress of wireless communications and embedded micro-electro-system technologies has made wireless sensor networks (WSN) very popular and even become part of our daily life. WSNs design are generally application driven, namely a particular application's requirements will determine how the network behaves. However, the natures of WSN have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its linear scalability, a small software footprint, low hardware implementation cost, low bandwidth requirement, and high device performance. It is noted that today's software applications are mainly characterized by their component-based structures which are usually heterogeneous and distributed, including the WSNs. But WSNs typically need to configure themselves automatically and support as hoc routing. Agent technology provides a method for handling increasing software complexity and supporting rapid and accurate decision making. This paper based on our previous works [1, 2], three contributions have made, namely (a) fuzzy controller for dynamic slide window size to improve the performance of running ECC (b) first presented a hidden generation point for protection from man-in-the middle attack and (c) we first investigates multi-agent applying for key exchange together. Security systems have been drawing great attentions as cryptographic algorithms have gained popularity due to the natures that make them suitable for use in constrained environment such as mobile sensor information applications, where computing resources and power availability are limited. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is one of high potential candidates for WSNs, which requires less computational power, communication bandwidth, and memory in comparison with other cryptosystem. For saving pre-computing storages recently there is a trend for the sensor networks that the sensor group leaders rather than sensors communicate to the end database, which highlighted the needs to prevent from the man-in-the middle attack. A designed a hidden generator point that offer a good protection from the man-in-the middle (MinM) attack which becomes one of major worries for the sensor's networks with multiagent system is also discussed. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={As wireless sensor networks mature, it becomes clear that the raw data collected by this technology can only be used in a meaningful way if it can be analyzed automatically. Describing the behavior of the data with a model, and then looking at the parameters of the model, or detecting differences between the model and the real data, is how experimental data is typically used in other fields. The work presented here aims at facilitating the use of sensor data models to describe the expected behavior of the sensor observations. The processing of such models can be pushed into the wireless sensor network to eliminate redundant information as early in the data collection chain as possible, thus minimizing both bandwidth requirements and energy consumption. © 2009 Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Our study is held in the context of the RIDER (Research for IT as a Driver of EneRgy eficiency) project, which is led by a consortium of several companies and research laboratories. The paper highlights various issues, including issues related to traceability, variability and automatic transformations in our specific application context. It then proposes solutions to apply existing concepts like feature diagrams, model-driven transformations and component-based architectures, or appropriate extensions of these concepts, in this context. Furthermore, we globally propose an approach to federate the various components involved in smart buildings, and to capitalize on the developed IT components by reusing them at the lower cost in the construction of future buildings.},

In this paper, an architecture of a component-based tool, named WiSeCoMaSys, is presented to integrate data monitoring from sensor networks, visualization, measurements and network management in a unique system. WiSeCoMaSys helps developers to debug their network deployments easily in many scenarios. Meanwhile, users can change a variety of parameters at any layer of the sensor node architecture to respond to network changes or optimize the performance. Moreover, statistic functionalities are also integrated in this tool to measure and evaluate the real time status of the entire network. With a completely integrated architecture, WiSeCoMaSys is a promising tool to interact with sensor networks visually in many sensing applications. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Accurate localization is crucial for wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks. Among the localization schemes, component-based approaches specialize in localization performance, which can properly conquer network sparseness and anchor sparseness. However, such design is sensitive to measurement errors. Existing robust localization methods focus on eliminating the positioning error of a single node. Indeed, a single node has two dimensions of freedom in 2D space and only suffers from one type of transformation: translation. As a rigid 2D structure, a component suffers from three possible transformations: translation, rotation, and reflection. A high degree of freedom brings about complicated cases of error productions and difficulties on error controlling. This study is the first work addressing how to deal with ranging noises for component- based methods. By exploiting a set of robust patterns, we present an Error-TOlerant Component-based algorithm (ETOC) that not only inherits the high-performance characteristic of component-based methods, but also achieves robustness of the result. We evaluate ETOC through a real-world sensor network consisting of 120 TelosB motes as well as extensive large-scale simulations. Experiment results show that, comparing with the-state-of-the-art designs, ETOC can work properly in sparse networks and provide more accurate localization results. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The integration of sensor networks with service oriented architectures requires explicit representations of sensor information and interfaces. A strong candidate language for modelling sensor information is SensorML. SensorML as opposed to other sensor modelling languages supports a specification of a process model associated with a sensor system. As a way of facilitating interaction with other decision making software modules this paper presents a translation procedure that leverages the SensorML modelling language and maps this into Java Bean software components and events. Software components design is a common approach for supporting high-level interoperability in software engineering. To demonstrate the value of this approach the translation procedure is compared against the more classical object-based approach used to develop a sensor web middleware platform. The results show that the use of SensorML to drive the software design of sensor components is simpler to that based on classical OO design. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This book chapter proposes a system based on the WirelessHART standard for monitoring and controlling oil platforms using sensor networks. The authors propose a hierarchical distributed system where sensor nodes and process components are grouped both functionally and in terms of proximity (i.e., spatially). They harness the existing electrical powering supplies to some of the process components to enhance our network routing protocol. They also propose a component based addressing scheme. Then propose a hybrid routing protocol having proactive paths for high priority data and reactive paths for low priority that can help in load balancing and thus improving the lifetime of the sensor network. Finally, the authors discuss about methodologies for assessing the health (residual energy) of the sensor network system. Related research is discussed at appropriate points. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={Next-generation sensor applications require system software and middleware that can be dynamically adapted to meet resource constraints on sensor nodes, as well as application specific requirements. The reflective middleware model has emerged as a de facto standard to attain inspection and adaptation in dynamic software systems. However, prior reflective frameworks in the field of sensor networks come with some drawbacks, such as imposing high resource demands on sensor nodes, and lacking a precise design model ended up with a tailored programming model. In this paper, we consider reflection in sensornets from a programming perspective and propose an event-driven, component-based framework addressing both base-level and meta-level inspection concerns within reflective sensor software. To efficiently utilize the event-driven nature of sensornets, we propose a new meta-space model for adaptive sensor systems, named Notification. The proposed framework also makes the implementation of the base-level simpler and more efficient. © 2010 ACM.},

Agent technology provides a method for handling increasing software complexity and supporting rapid and accurate decision making. This paper first investigated multiagent applying for key exchange. Security systems have been drawing great attentions as cryptographic algorithms have gained popularity due to the natures that make them suitable for use in constrained environment such as mobile sensor information applications, where computing resources and power availability are limited. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is one of them, which requires less computational power, communication bandwidth, and memory in comparison with other cryptosystem. In particularly, for saving pre-computing storages recently there is a trend for the sensor networks that the sensor group leaders rather than sensors communicate to the end database, which highlighted the needs to prevent from the man-in-the middle attack. Due to the multi-agent system (MAS) used the whole system becomes easy to be used. In particularly we designed a hidden generator point that offer a good protection from the man-in-the middle (MinM) attack which becomes one of major worries for the sensor's networks with MAS. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

abstract={Over the last years Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been becoming increasingly applicable for real world scenarios and now production ready solutions are available. In the same period the upcoming combination of Service-oriented Architectures and Web Service technology demonstrated a way to realize open standardized, flexible, service component based, loosely coupled and interoperable cross domain enterprise software solutions. But those solutions have been too resource-intensive and complex to be applicable for limited devices like wireless sensor nodes or small-sized embedded systems. Thus, more and more research investigations have been launched to bring the aspect of cross domain interoperability to the field of embedded battery powered devices. The proposed laboratory assistance solution in this paper demonstrates the benefits of Web Service enabled WSNs for process monitoring and disaster management by extending an existing system in the Life Science Automation domain. Especially, the capability to provide location based services in industrial automation environment represents a beneficial feature of the presented integration approach and results in high-quality information delivery bundled with specific data about the locational origin of the capturing sensor. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The increasing number of distributed applications over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in ubiquitous environments raises the need for high-level mechanisms to distribute sensor services and integrate them in modern IT systems. Existing work in this area mostly focuses on low-level networking issues, and fails to provide high-level and off-the-shelf programming abstractions for this purpose. In this paper, we therefore considerWSN programming models and service distribution as two interrelated factors and we present a new component-based abstraction for integrating WSNs within existing IT systems. Our approach emphasizes on reifying distribution strategies at the software architecture level, thus allowing remote invocation of component services, and facilitating interoperability of sensor services with the Internet through Web service-enabled components. The latter is efficiently provided by incorporating the REST architectural style-emphasizing on abstraction of high-level services as resources- to our component-based framework. The preliminary evaluation results show that the proposed framework has an acceptable memory overhead on a TelosB sensor platform. © Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Run-time reconfigurable component models have been highlighted as having particular potential in networked embedded systems. In these models, explicit interface definitions promote the re-use of generic units of functionality between application compositions, while run-time reconfiguration provides a mechanism to manage the dynamism of sensor network environments. Despite these advantages, in current systems, reliably re-using and reconfiguring distributed components is a complex undertaking. It requires a detailed understanding of the services offered by each component. The lack hereof effectively precludes run-time discovery and use of third-party components. This paper proposes the embedding of compact semantic descriptions in component interfaces and associated messages. These descriptions allow for efficient compatibility checking and therefore facilitate the run-time discovery and use of third-party component services. We demonstrate that this scheme is feasible in even the most resource-constrained sensor network environments. © Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={To address the problem of outlier detection in wireless sensor networks, in this paper we propose a robust principal component analysis based technique to detect anomalous or faulty sensor data in a distributed wireless sensor network with a focus on data integrity and accuracy problem. The main key features are that it considers the correlation existing among the sensor data in order to disclose anomalies that span through a number of neighboring sensors, does not require error free data for PCA model construction and the operation takes place in a distributed fashion. In this paper, a two-step algorithm is proposed. First, the intent was to find an accurate estimate of the correlation of sensor data to build up a robust PCA model that could then be used for fault detection. This locally developed correlation based robust PCA model tends to accentuate the contribution of close observations in comparison with distant observations and does not impose any constraints in model design. Second, we use mahalanobis distance, a multivariate distance metric to determine the similarity between the current sensor readings against the developed sensor data model. Combined with component analysis, mahalanobis distance is extended to examine whether a sensor node is an outlier from a model defined by principal components based on principal component analysis. We examined the algorithm's performance using simulation with synthetic and real sensor data streams. The results clearly show that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy even when processing corrupted data. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a growing interest in leveraging Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) in domains such as home automation, automotive, mobile phones or e-Health. With the basic idea (supported in e.g. OSGi) that components provide services, it makes it possible to smoothly integrate the Internet of Things (IoT) with the Internet of Services (IoS). The paradigm of the IoS indeed offers interesting capabilities in terms of dynamicity and interoperability. However in domains that involve "things" (e.g. appliances), there is still a strong need for loose coupling and a proper separation between types and instances that are well-known in Component-Based approaches but that typical SOA fail to provide. This paper presents how we can still get the best of both worlds by augmenting SOA with a Component-Based approach. We illustrate our approach with a case study from the domain of home automation. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={To overcome system latency and network delay is essential for intervehicle communication (IVC) applications such as hazard alarming and cooperative driving. This paper proposes a low-cost embedded software system dedicated to such applications. It consists of two basic component layers: an operating system, named HEROS (hybrid event-driven and real-time multitasking operating system), and a communication protocol, named CIVIC (Communication Inter Véhicule Intelligente et Coopérative). HEROS is originally designed for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It contains a component-based resource-aware kernel and a low-latency tuple-based communication system. Moreover, it provides a configurable event-driven and/or real-time multitasking mechanism for various embedded applications. The CIVIC is an autoconfiguration cooperative IVC protocol. It merges proactive and reactive approaches to speed up and optimize location-based routing discovery with high-mobility nodes. Currently, this embedded system has been implemented and tested. The experiment results show that the new embedded system has low system latency and network delay under the principle of small resource consumption. Copyright © 2010 Xunxing Diao et al.},

abstract={In this paper we investigate the problem of reactive on-line bandwidth allocation in adaptive Wireless Sensor Networks. In adaptive WSN for monitoring applications, nodes can react to physical events by adapting their behavior, for instance increasing the amount of computation to be performed, or reducing the amount of consumed energy. Accordingly, the nodes may increase or decrease their bandwidth requirements. Hence, a reconfiguration algorithm is needed to reallocate the bandwidth to the different nodes, to maximize a certain global quality index. To address this problem, we first present a componentbased methodology to model nodes and cluster of nodes as components. Then, we use this methodology to decompose the global optimization problem into simpler local problems, so to enable the design of scalable heuristic algorithms. We propose two different heuristic algorithms, and we compare their performance by extensive simulations against a global optimization procedure based on the Simplex algorithm. We demonstrate that our proposed heuristics perform very well under almost all circumstances. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Considerable research has been performed in applying run-time reconfigurable component models to the domain of wireless sensor networks. The ability to dynamically deploy and reconfigure software components has clear advantages in sensor networks, which are typically large in scale and expected to operate for long periods in the face of node mobility, dynamic environmental conditions, and changing application requirements. LooCI is a component and binding model that is optimized for use in resource-constrained environments such as Wireless Sensor Networks. LooCI components use a novel event-based binding model that allows developers to model rich component interactions, while providing support for run-time reconfiguration, reflection, and policy-based management. This paper reports on the design of LooCI and describes a prototype implementation for the Sun SPOT. This platform is then evaluated in context of a real-world river monitoring and warning scenario in the city of São Carlos, Brazil. Copyright © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={Over the last years Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been becoming increasingly applicable for real world scenarios and now production ready solutions are available. In the same period the upcoming combination of Service-oriented Architectures and Web Service technology demonstrated a way to realize open standardized, flexible, service component based, loosely coupled and interoperable cross domain Enterprise Software solutions. But those solutions have been too resource-intensive and complex to be applicable for limited devices like wireless sensor nodes or small-sized embedded systems. Thus, more and more research investigations have been launched to bring the aspect of cross domain interoperability to the field of embedded battery powered devices. Now it is time to show the potential of integrating Web Services enabled WSN solutions in Enterprise systems. The proposed laboratory assistance solution in this paper demonstrates the benefits of Web Service enabled WSNs for process monitoring and disaster management by extending an existing system in the Life Science Automation domain. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The success of high-level programming models in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is heavily dependent on factors such as ease of programming, code well-structuring, degree of code reusability, and required software development effort. Component-based programming has been recognized as an effective approach to meet such requirements. Most of componentization efforts in WSNs were ineffective due to various reasons, such as high resource demand or limited scope of use. In this paper, we present Remora, a new approach to practical and efficient component-based programming in WSNs. Remora offers a well-structured programming paradigm that fits very well with resource limitations of embedded systems, including WSNs. Furthermore, the special attention to event handling in Remora makes our proposal more practical for WSN applications, which are inherently event-driven. More importantly, the mutualism between Remora and underlying system software promises a new direction towards separation of concerns in WSNs. Our evaluation results show that a well-configured Remora application has an acceptable memory overhead and a negligible CPU cost. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network consistsing of spatially distributed autonomous device using sensors to cooperatively monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants at different locations. A complete model of a sensor network is needed to improve upon its efficiency and design.Using a modeling and simulation tool called Visualsense models of these in this paper will discuss the implementation and creation of a sensor node in Visualsense.In the Visualsense analyses of a sensor network, several factors affecting a network are relized such as battery life and signal range of the device.Modeling of wireless sensor networks requires sophisticated modeling of communication channels, sensor channels, adhoc networking protocols, localization strategies, media access control protocols, energy consumption in sensor nodes, etc.this modeling framework is designed to support a component- based construction of such models. It is intended to enable the research community to share models of disjoint aspects of the sensor nets problem and to build models that include sophisticated elements from several aspects. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Web 2.0 communities emerge regularly with the growing need for domain-specific programming over Web APIs. Even though Web mashups provide access to Web APIs, they ignore domain-specific programming needs. On the other hand, developing domain-specific languages (DSLs) is costly and not feasible for such ad hoc communities. We propose User Language Domain (ULD): an intermediate Web-based architecture using a domain-specific embedded languages approach that reduces the cost of DSL development to plugging the Web APIs into a host end user programming language. We have implemented the proposed architecture in the context of smart devices, where we plug the functionality of different Lego Mindstorms devices into a Web-based visual programming language. We expect that several domains, such as smart homes or wearable computers can use the ULD architecture to reduce development effort. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, networked embedded systems (NESs) are required to be reconfigurable in order to be customizable to different operating environments and/or adaptable to changes in operating environment. However, reconfigurability acts against security as it introduces new sources of vulnerability. In this paper, we propose a security architecture that integrates, enriches and extends a component-based middleware layer with abstractions and mechanisms for secure reconfiguration and secure communication. The architecture provides a secure communication service that enforces application-specific fine-grained security policy. Furthermore, in order to support secure reconfiguration at the middleware level, the architecture provides a basic mechanism for authenticated downloading from a remote source. Finally, the architecture provides a rekeying service that performs key distribution and revocation. The architecture provides the services as a collection of middleware components that an application developer can instantiate according to the application requirements and constraints. The security architecture extends the middleware by exploiting the decoupling and encapsulation capabilities provided by components. It follows that the architecture results itself reconfigurable and can span heterogeneous devices. The security architecture has been implemented for different platforms including low-end, resource-poor ones such as Tmote Sky sensor devices. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Autonomous smart sensor is a highly integrated turn-key device, operates independently and owns itself life cycle. Networked sensors exchange information with protocols; we designed an application-layer protocol named AgileSN making sensor nodes interoperable and interchangeable. AgileSN sensor node itself and captured data that protocol carried are self-descriptive, with these smart capabilities, sensor nodes can be automatically detected or searched by interested peers or sink nodes, and sensor data can be parsed dynamically on the fly without human intervention, made autonomous sensor nodes plug and play in the network world. Like WEB system, well accepted network protocol make networked sensors interchangeable and interoperable, universal sensor tools are possible to process sensed data. We have designed a component-based software tool for sensor application development. In this software environment, all application functionalities are realized through software components, each component is designed to finish a special task, like reading data from networked sensors, data processing, visual presentation, network or local file I/O, HMI, etc. sensor data is processed sequentially by several components through data flow. A component can operate in its own thread, carefully designed component makes the whole data processing flow operates in pipeline mode, greatly improve data processing throughput. Components and data routes can be created and destroyed at runtime, so the application system functionality is reconfigured. We apply the Petri Net tool to model components and the whole application system, investigate their function and performance, present a non-collision high-performance soft-bus for inter-component data transfer, investigate the hazard phenomenon that exists in a multi-input component, and propose technical means to eliminate it. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={As smart home environment gets more and more diverse with newly evolved devices and applications, instead of programming each household, there is a need for a knowledge-based framework to facilitate the automatic composition of appropriate services. The framework should address the issues of finding suitable devices automatically, composing feasible plans, and making the composed plans executable. In this paper, we propose a way to compose the executable plans for the smart home devices based on ontology-base process models. A code generator and an execution environment are then discussed. The generated code can be deployed and scheduled in the execution environment. It can also query the ontology and dynamically find any possible replacements from registered devices at runtime. To demonstrate the framework, an experiment with a simple application is included in the paper. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we examine the current state of the art in WSN operating systems in terms of their general programming models and runtime reprogramming features. While all OSs admit the need - and provide some capability - for runtime reprogramming, we find that no existing OS employs a unified approach at the dynamic end of the spectrum. In this paper we present such a unified solution with a new OS design called Lorien. Lorien is a dynamic component-oriented OS aimed at permitting component-based changes to itself, including architectural change, throughout every aspect of the system at runtime including its kernel. A Lorien system typically permits 43KB - 90% - of program memory on the TelosB platform to be fully reprogrammable within a unified programming model, supporting rich future middleware and systems research in the WSN field.

abstract={In this paper we present a novel cross-correlator chip suitable for "smart" ECG electrodes. Sophisticated QRS-detection is feasible exploring multi-component based cross-correlation and by exploiting the simplicity offered by bitstream processing. The chip is evaluated using real ECG signals as an example application. Power-efficient running cross-correlation is obtained with novel asynchronous circuit solutions consuming only approx. 5 mW. The implemented generic cross-correlator may be explored for other pattern-matching applications in wireless sensor networks or other low-power applications. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Tiny devices, smart objects, home gateways, sensor networks, have become an integral part of our everyday life and of our socio-economic ecosystem. However their large number, their distribution and their volatility and heterogeneity make their management fiendishly complex. Traditional management systems, that are mainly ad-hoc or centralized, reach their limits in such complex management contexts. This paper introduces our response to overcome these difficulties by proposing a flexible management middleware for multi-scale contexts. This middleware named DASIMA, implements a new approach combining domain-based and architecture-based management. DASIMA is a fully component-based management middleware intended to scale-up and down according to the number and the distribution of managed resources. This proposal breaks with current management paradigms mainly related to quite rigid and monolithic systems. DASIMA has been experimented in a real industrial application in the Machine to Machine (M2M) context. These experiments confirm the interest of developing adaptable middleware to manage networked systems in multi-scale contexts. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Faulty components in a network need to be localized and repaired to sustain the health of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that carefully combines active and passive measurements to localize faults in wireless sensor networks. More specifically, we formulate a problem of optimal sequential testing guided by end-to-end data. This problem determines an optimal testing sequence of network components based on end-to-end data in sensor networks to minimize testing cost. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. Extensive simulation shows that in most settings our algorithm only requires testing a very small set of network components to localize and repair all faults in the network. Our approach is superior to using active and passive measurements in isolation. It also outperforms the state-of-theart approaches that localize and repair all faults in a network. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider distributed state estimation and fusion in autonomic adhoc sensor networks when some nodes are untrusted, corrupted or malicious. We provide rigorous graph models to capture both trust and network functionality relations. We propose a novel hierarchical scheme, inspired from socio-cognitive dynamics in economics and sociology, that utilizes a trusted core. We provide a component-based architecture to show the interplay between the trust and estimation schemes. As an explanatory example we consider the problem of distributed Kalman filtering. We show that trust-based schemes, implemented by a trusted core, result in significant improvement in the state estimation procedure. We also find that the interplay between estimation and trust updates quickly isolates malicious nodes and helps the observation limited nodes (corrupted sensor nodes). ©2009 ISIF.},

abstract={With the application of sensor networks in industrial, commercial, and medical areas, sensor operating system should be revisited to handle dependability problem. In this paper, we present a novel component-based sensor operating system, MTOS (Micro-Transformers Operating System), which supports adaptive dynamic reconfiguration for resource-constrained sensor nodes to achieve dependability. Through error-driven reconfiguration and change-driven reconfiguration, MTOS can push a system into a stable state in which errors can be recovered with minimized side effects and changes can be safely made without interruption of normal services. The experimental results show that our approach can improve the dependability efficiently. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper primarily studies sensor network interchangeability and its application development. We propose an architecture framework to realize node interchangeability and point out that both transport layer and application layer protocols should be in accordance with their peer respectively. A lightweight application-layer protocol named AgileSN is proposed, which supports node auto-detection and dynamic data parsing; the network and node models and working process of AgileSN is described in detail. On the foundation of node interchangeability, we adopt WEB browser dynamic interactive models with servers to build a suite of run-time reconfigurable virtual instrumentation platform, named IsVIP, which applies component-based architecture, has the ability to build and edit applications on the fly, supports multiple data-flow and pipeline parallelism, and greatly improves throughput. IsVIP internal model is described and its performance is investigated and tested. At the end, an example is given, which applies a simulated AgileSN node and IsVIP to rapidly build a PC performance monitoring system.},

abstract={An increasing number of research efforts on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are now considering dynamic environments with heterogeneous sensor devices. Most of this research considers data, control, and management issues separately and not clearly within a common architecture. This paper presents our development of an architecture, namely DCM-Arch, to address these issues together. The architecture consists of three-planes of functionalities (in the vertical dimension): 1) data, 2) control, and 3) management; and fourtiers of network infrastructures (in the horizontal dimension): 1) routing and network infrastructure, 2) logical network infrastructure, 3) adaptation middleware, and 4) componentbased software application. The data plane handles the information storage, reduction, and dissemination in WSNs. The control plane deals with the lightweight sensor adaptation and reconfiguration middleware to cope with the dynamic changes of the environment. Finally, the management plane provides the context management functions, e.g. for collaboration and reasoning, to allow sensors, coordinators, and sinks to make good decisions about adaptation and reconfiguration. While the vertical dimension describes the functionalities of DCM-Arch, its four-tiers provide the required facilities to achieve those functionalities. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={We introduce our tool-suite that facilitates automated testing of applications for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs are highly distributed systems and therefore require a testing infrastructure. We present a general-purpose testing framework which enables component, integration, and system testing. When using our testing framework, test cases have to be implemented by several modules. To coordinate the execution of these modules synchronization code must be written which is a complex and time consuming task. To bypass this task and thus make the test case implementation process more efficient, we introduce a model-driven approach that delegates this task to the code generator. Thereto, the test scenario is represented in a model and the code of the modules is generated. This model also eases the task of isolating faults in the code of the application being tested because the model can be refined to get insights on the application's behavior to backtrack the cause of the failure reproduced by the test case. © 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract={Applications for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being spread to areas in which the contextual parameters modeling the environment are changing over the application lifespan. Whereas software adaptation has been identified as an effective approach for addressing context-aware applications, the existing work on WSNs fails to support context-awareness and mostly focuses on developing techniques to reprogram the whole sensor node rather than reconfiguring a particular portion of the sensor application software. Therefore, enabling adaptivity in the higher layers of a WSN architecture such as the middleware and application layers, beside the consideration in the lower layers, becomes of high importance. In this paper, we propose a distributed component-based middleware approach, named WiSeKit, to enable adaptation and reconfiguration of WSN applications. In particular, this proposal aims at providing an abstraction to facilitate development of adaptive WSN applications. As resource availability is the main concern of WSNs, the preliminary evaluation shows that our middleware approach promises a lightweight, fine-grained and communication-efficient model of application adaptation with a very limited memory and energy overhead. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In product lines for systems engineering a number of different viewpoints on the modeled system have to maintained, comprising both software-related viewpoints and domain-specific views on hardware and environment. A major engineering challenge is to maintain model transformations and code generators working on these viewpoints. This paper proposes an engineering approach that explicitly describes the relation between viewpoints. We use these descriptions to better modularize transformations and thus improve the maintainability of MDD tool chains. This is shown within a smart home case study, which combines building automation and software engineering. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Distributed wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being proposed for various applications including defense, security, and smart stages. The introduction of hardware wireless sensors in a signal processing education setting can serve as a paradigm for data acquisition, collaborative signal processing, or simply as a platform for obtaining, processing, and analyzing real-life real-time data. In this paper, a software interface that enables the java-digital signal processing (J-DSP) visual programming environment to communicate in a two-way manner with a wireless sensor network is presented. This interface was developed by writing nesC (an extension to the C programming language for sensors) code that enables J-DSP to issue commands to multiple wireless sensor motes, activate specific transducers, and analyze data using any of the existing J-DSP signal processing functions in real time. A series of exercises were developed and disseminated to provide hardware experiences to signals and systems and signal processing undergraduate students. The hardware with the J-DSP software has been used for two semesters in the senior level digital signal processing (DSP) course at Arizona State University. The interface, the exercises, and their assessment (instruments and results) are described in the paper. © 2009 IEEE.},

Our contribution is three folds-First, the proposed component based selective encryption scheme achieves high image security, while incurring little encryption overhead; furthermore, the proposed adaptive encryption scheme achieve the best security effort within delay bound; finally, the proposed transmission rate optimization improves energy efficiency, and feeds back effective path capacity parameters for adaptive encryption. Simulation results show a significant gain in both energy efficiency and security based on the proposed approach for image secure transmissions in WSN. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={We develop an approach of component software reliability analysis which includes the benefits of both time domain, and structure based approaches. This approach overcomes the deficiency of existing NHPP techniques that fall short of addressing repair, and internal system structures simultaneously. Our solution adopts a method of transformation of testing data to cover both methods, and is expected to improve reliability prediction. This paradigm allows component-based software testing process doesn't meet the assumption of NHPP models, and accounts for software structures by the way of modeling the testing process. According to the testing model it builds the mapping relation from the testing profile to the operational profile which enables the transformation of the testing data to build the reliability dataset required by NHPP models. At last an example is evaluated to validate and show the effectiveness of this approach. © 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract={This paper describes an update mechanism for large wireless ad-hoc sensor networks (WASNs). In wireless sensor networks, the nodes may have to be reprogrammed, especially for design-implement-test iterations. Manually reprogramming is a very cumbersome work, and may be infeasible if nodes of the network are unreachable. Therefore, a wireless update mechanism is needed. Exchanging the running application on a node by transmitting the complete program image is not efficient for small changes in the code. It consumes a lot of bandwidth and time. The proposed framework, Adaptive SmartMote, defines and supports control JOBs that allow computation, behaviors. The goal of this paper is to use programmable packet to update sensor behaviors. To reduce the code transferred and power consumption, we propose a group management architecture. This architecture helps reduce power consumption and increase node number that control by Leader Node in WASNs. The proposed update protocol has been implemented on the Tmote-based Octopus II sensor node, which is named SmartMote, which runs TinyOS [1], a component-based operating system for highly constraint embedded platform. © 2009 by Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an emergent multi-disciplinary science, and it may be considered as the foundation of pervasive computing, mobile computing and wearable computing. WSN is a very active and competitive research area due to its diverse and unlimited potential applications: air, underground and underwater. In spite of its young age, economic impact of WSN is important, for examples the industrial control segment market will be worth $5.3B by 2010 and the smart home market will be worth $2.8 billion worldwide by 2012 (Source: Stamatis Karnouskos, EU-US 08 Workshop). WSN is a set of wireless nodes. On one hand, each wireless node (WN) has similar hardware and software functionalities as a PC: CPU, memory, operating system, and communication protocol to fulfill a specific task. On the other hand, a WN has a limited power supply (embedded battery) and consumes approximately 1 million less power (~100μW instead of ~100W) than a PC. Due to resources constraints: energy consumption and form factor, the approaches applied in general purpose computer systems are not adapted to the requirements of WSN. When it comes to the design of energy efficient oriented hardware and software components of WSN, cross-layering optimization approaches are generally adopted such as application-specific unified hardware and software by taking into account the following criteria: trade-off between complexity, efficiency and resource consumption, and application context (context-aware) etc. Currently two main hardware development and design trends are carried out to implement the WN: Commercial OffThe-Shelf 'COTS' and System on Chip 'SoC'. The first and second generations of WN were designed by using low power 8-bit or 16-bit microcontroller processor core, Bluetooth and non standard wireless access medium (MICA Mote). The current trend of WN design such as Tmotesky, iMote and LiveNode are based on low power 16-bit or 32-bit RISC microcontroller, and full compliance IEEE802.14.5 standard. However the ultimate goal of all the researchers in the world is the implementation of long life, low cost and invisible WN integrated and embedded into environment. Three key technologies make possible to achieve this objective: MEMS 'MicroElectroMEchanical systems', UWB 'Ultra-Wide Band' and low power CMOS technology. Different WN prototypes are realized by Intel (iMOTE2), University of Michigan (MOTE: Michigan Uni Prototype) and University of Berkeley (Pico-Mote). WN hardware seems easier to solve than embedded software for diverse WSN applications. The main questions which are related to WSN basic software design is how to keep modularity, high level abstraction and reliability to enable to implement complex massively distributed WSNs to meet resource constraint requirements. Real-time operating system (RTOS) plays a key role to support high level abstraction and distributed collaborative processing. Currently four categories of WSN's RTOS are developed: Event driven (TinyOS), Multitask (RETOS, tKernel, NutOS, MANTIS), Data-Centric (AmbientRT), and Hybrid (Contiki, LIMOS). Note that TinyOS is very popular but it not adapted to complex hard real-time application. The development challenges of the WSN RTOS are energy-efficiency (context aware, configurable, small footprint), robustness, fault tolerance, support hard real-time constraint, and support component based model (high level of abstraction to ease the integration of high level SW such as protocol, middleware, application, and simulator). Furthermore, for WSN applications, message sending is energy consuming. Thus it is important to implement embedded energy efficient wireless routing protocol to increase WSN lifetime. It is clear that general purpose MANET routing protocol such as AODV (active), OLSR (proactive) and ZBR (hybrid) etc. are not suitable for WSN due to resource constraints. For example optimal routing path is well adapted to general purpose MANET but not suitable for WSN because the repetitive use of the same path will exhaust the battery of WNs belonging to the optimal routing path (black hole). Many WSN dedicated protocols are implemented (spin, cougar, gear, leach, speed...) but it is currently very difficult to have a clear idea concerning their performance (energy consumption, scalability, connectivity, lifetime...) because of the lack of large scale WSN real world experimentation results and because the simulation model does not reflect the real-world ones (physical layer). Note that, there is no standard scenario and the application program (with a known number of WNs) enables to evaluate rationally the performance of wireless routing protocols. In addition routing protocol relies on the WSN topology. On one hand, an optimal WSN topology facilitates the implementation of routing and administration protocols. On the other hand, the deployment of large scale WS nodes in a large area is random and its topology is a priori unknown. Then, it is important to investigate the auto-configuration algorithms to increase the efficiency of routing and administration protocols. However the frontier between the administration protocol and the routing protocol is not as clearly defined as in a classical network (e.g. TCP/IP and SNMP) due to cross-layering approach. Moreover WSN security, reliability, and fault tolerance are still an open problem. In this special issue 5 papers are selected among 40 submitted papers for the NTMS workshop on wireless sensor network: theory and practice, held at Tangier at Morocco in 2008, the rest of the papers are selected from an open call for paper. WSN is a multi-disciplinary science. It impossible to present all its topics but this special issue addresses most of the WSN embedded software problems dealing with real-world applications (EU NeT-ADDED FP6 project, French ANR research project and industrial projects). The first paper investigates the operating system dedicated to WSN and proposes a new native hybrid real-time operating system, named HEROS 'Hybrid Embedded Real-time Operating System', which may be configured to run in different modes: event-driven, multitask or event-driven and multitask to adapt to diverse domains of WSN applications. Furthermore, to ease distributed cooperative application, HEROS adopts LINDA concept by providing a simplified tuple space and a lightweight IN/OUT primitive-pair to achieve system communication & synchronization. The second paper describes a new MANET protocol dedicated to intelligent transport system, named CIVIC (Communication Inter Véhicule Intelligente et Coopérative). The CIVIC protocol is a location-based routing protocol supporting infrastructure and ad-hoc networks. CIVIC is a hybrid protocol including reactive and proactive routing processes. The third paper presents an autonomous network structure including its target-oriented routing algorithm named SCAR 'Sequential Coordinate Routing Algorithm'. Besides the target-oriented property as a main feature of the SCAR, based on the mathematical claim and its proof, it is shown how the minimum energy consumption is taken into consideration. The fourth paper investigates the QoS of routing protocol to meet the requirement of real-time monitoring applications. The cross-layering techniques from MAC to application layers are adopted to improve the performance of the whole network. The authors show that the proposed cross layering protocols enable to reduce the delay and minimize energy consumption. The fifth paper presents a new auto-configuration algorithm based on graph optimization techniques to minimize WSN energy consumption by taking into-account the robustness and the network coverage. The key issue of this problem is the energy-efficient topology design. In this work, four heuristic strategies are proposed for designing WSN topologies. The sixth paper proposes a density control algorithm for wireless sensor networks to keep as few sensors as possible in active state to achieve a connected coverage of a specific area of interest. Inactive sensors can turn off sensing modules to save energy. Unlike other algorithms, the proposed one does not rely on position information or ranging information of sensors. Providing a powerful synchronization system is one of the most important goals to be pursued if an efficient utilization of sensor networks has to be addressed. The seventh paper proposes a novel synchronization system based on Kohonens Self Organizing Maps (SOMs), able to provide some Artificial Intelligence features to sensor nodes. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm, and present some important features such as the properties that the synchronization error does not increase when the number of nodes grows and that the percentage of needed anchors nodes is really very low. The eighth paper presents an approach of component software reliability analysis which includes the benefits of both time domain, and structure based approaches. To overcome the deficiency of existing NHPP techniques that fall short of addressing repair and internal system structures simultaneously, a technique of transformation of testing data is proposed to improve prediction reliability. This new approach is evaluated and validated through an example to show its effectiveness. I hope that this special issue, which deals with basic embedded WSN software: operating system, routing protocol, auto-configuration, synchronization and component software reliability analysis will contribute significantly to advance the WSN research. Finally I would like to thank all the authors for their interesting contributions and the quality of their work, as well as all the Technical Program Committee members who also contributed significantly to improve the quality of this special issue.},

abstract={We introduce our tool-suite that facilitates automated testing of applications for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs are highly distributed systems and therefore require a testing infrastructure. We introduce a general purpose testing framework which enables component, integration, and system testing. When using our testing framework test cases have to be implemented by several modules. To coordinate the execution of those modules synchronization code must be written which is a complex and time-consuming task. To bypass this task and thus make the test case implementation process more efficient, we introduce a model-driven approach that delegates this task to the code generator. Thereto the test scenario is represented in a model and the code of the modules is generated. This model also eases the task to isolate faults in the code of the application being tested because the model can be refined to get insights on the application's behavior to backtrack the cause of the failure reproduced by the test case. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={SmartBee is a vertical solution given to control/monitor smart home/office devices, interconnecting IP and ZigBee networks. The key product of the system is SmartBee Gateway. In one end, it is connected with SmartBee enabled End Devices through ZigBee network. On the other end, it connects to internet so that the devices are accessible via multiple channels using IP. SmartBee Specification is introduced to manufacturers so that they can produce SmartBee enabled End Devices. It includes the communication protocol that is used between SmartBee Gateway and a particular SmartBee enabled End Device. It also provides guidelines to implement plug & play feature and authorization of the device for security. On IP side, SmartBee Gateway can connect to the SmartBee Central Management Server (CMS) through internet. CMS facilitates the multi-Chanel accessibility through web and mobile interfaces and third party applications which consumes the SmartBee Web Service. Thus home/office users can control/monitor their devices through internet. The web interface also facilitates to manufacturers to manage their profiles and SmartBee Device Packages, which introduces the particular SmartBee enabled End Device category to SmartBee System. For the purpose of demonstration of system functionality, compatibility and implementation of SmartBee specification, several example end devices as a power switch, a stepper motor, a Light intensity sensor and a SmartBee extender which extends the physical distance of the network, are implemented and controlled © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Localization is crucial for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. As the distance-measurement ranges are often less than that of the communication range for many ranging systems, most communication-dense wireless networks are often localization-sparse. Consequently, most existing algorithms fail to provide accurate localization supports. In order to address this issue, by introducing a concept of component, we propose to group nodes into components, so that nodes are able to better share their ranging and anchor knowledge. This design, CALL, relaxes two essential restrictions in localization: node ordering and anchor distribution. We evaluate the effectiveness of CALL through extensive simulations. The results show that CALL locates 80% nodes in a network with average degree 7.5 and 5% percent anchors, which outperforms the state of the art design Sweeps about 20%.©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Using routing technique, wireless sensor network WSN can route sensor data quickly. As there is only one next hop, transmissions can be fast. However, routed data only traverses its end-to-end path. So routing data to every node is difficult. Additionally, verifying transmission to each destination can be prohibitively expensive. Broadcast technique can scalably reach every node in a sensor network. Current sensor network routing protocols running on the mica2 hardware platform can route across approximately ten hops in a second after considering retransmissions, media access and contention [12], [14], [20]. The trickle broadcast protocol transmits at most once a second to minimize packet losses due to collisions [2]. This study presents a way to combine routing and broadcasting techniques to achieve reliable propagation of data packets. It brings out clearly, the reliability with which the control packets are propagated to all the nodes deployed in the network, as compared to pure broadcast based dissemination. Reliably disseminating a piece of data to every node is a basic requirement for WSNs.},

abstract={Sense-and-react applications are characterised by the fact that actuators are able to react to data collected by sensors and change the monitored environment. With the introduction of nodes sporting actuators, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being used for realising such applications. Sensor and actuator nodes are capable of interact locally. As a result, the logic that coordinates the activities of the different nodes towards a common goals has to be embedded in the network itself. In this scenario, the development of applications becomes more complex. In this paper, we present a component-based framework that facilitates the development of sense-and-react applications promoting reuse of code. While applications components are used to implement basic functionalities (sense and reaction) our framework allows the specification of application-domain requirements. Our framework is composed of a Publish/Subscribe Broker, a component-based service layer and a Policy Manager. The broker manages subscriptions information and the service layer provides mechanisms orthogonal to publish/subscribe core (e.g., diffusion protocols, data communication protocols, data encryption, etc.). The novelty of our approach is the introduction of the Policy Manager where policies are enforced. Policies are rules that govern the choices and behaviour of the system. They can be used for specifying which services have to be associated with the broker operations. Moreover, policies can embed rules for coordinating the activities of the different sensors and actuators for reaching the common goals of applications. © 2008 Springer.},

abstract={We present a model-driven test environment called Visual ScatterUnit, which optimizes the application testing process of wireless sensor networks. Instead of having to implement the test case completely manually, the model-driven test environment allows the abstract modeling of the test process. At the same time the test case's technical implementation requirements are kept hidden from the user. In the following a code generator is able to create the necessary test case code, which complies with technical requirements from the test case model. The test case is executed with the help of Visual ScatterUnit and the test results are subsequently visualized in the test case model's diagrams. In this way the user can easily comprehend the test run and consequently understand the cause of failure. Furthermore the test case's abstract modeling allows it to be validated, which brings with it a quality assurance for the executable test case. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

According to this standard, a Function Block (abbreviated FB) is an event triggered component owning data and a control application is a FB network that has to meet temporal properties according to user requirements. This FB network is totally changed or modified if a dynamic reconfiguration scenario is applied at run-time. To cover all reconfiguration cases, we classify all possible scenarios in three classes and we define an agent-based architecture designed with nested state machines to automatically handle all possible dynamic reconfigurations. ©2008 IEEE.},

A Function Block (denoted by FB) is an event triggered component owning data and a Reconfigurable Control Application is specified by different FB networks such as each one has to be automatically loaded in memory when a particular reconfiguration scenario is followed. To verify the whole temporal behavior of the system, we check the feasibility of each FB network corresponding to a possible reconfiguration scenario by exploring reachability graphs which will be transformed into OS tasks of the execution environment. Therefore, the Reconfigurable System is assigned into different sets of OS tasks such as each set corresponds to a particular reconfiguration scenario. We developed the tool X - Recon fig supporting the paper contribution that we apply on the FESTO production system available in our laboratory at the Martin Luther University. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={There are several important properties of modern software systems. They tend to be large-scale with distributed and component-based architectures. Also, dynamic nature of operating environments leads them to utilize alternative algorithms. However, on the other hand, these properties make it hard to provide appropriate control mechanisms due to the increased complexity. Components are sharing resources and each component can have alternative algorithms. As a result, the behavior of a software system can be controlled through resource allocation, as well as algorithm selection. This novel control problem is worthy of investigation in order to double the benefits of those properties. In this paper, we design a control mechanism for such systems. The quality-of-service we are considering is a product of the value of solution and the time for generating solution for a given problem. We build a mathematical programming model that trades off these two conflicting objectives, and decentralize the model through an auction market. By periodically opening the auction market for each existing system state, a closed-loop policy is formed. Though similar problems can be found in multiprocessor scheduling literature, they have limitations in addressing this control problem. They commonly consider so-called workflow applications in which each component only has to process one task after all of its predecessors complete their tasks. In contrast, a component in the networks under consideration processes multiple tasks in parallel with its successors or predecessors. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks are often used by experts in many different fields to gather data pertinent to their work. Although their expertise may not include software engineering, these users are expected to produce low-level software for a concurrent, real-time and resource-constrained computing environment. In this paper, we introduce a component-based model for wireless sensor network applications and a language, Insense, for supporting the model. An application is modelled as a composition of interacting components and the application model is preserved in the Insense implementation where active components communicate via typed channels. The primary design criteria for Insense include: to abstract over low-level concerns for ease of programming; to permit worst-case space and time usage of programs to be determinable; to support the fractal composition of components whilst eliminating implicit dependencies between them; and, to facilitate the construction of low footprint programs suitable for resource-constrained devices. This paper presents an overview of the component model and Insense, and demonstrates how they meet the above criteria. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={At present, the OSs (Operating system) employed for WSN (wireless sensor networks) are either satisfied with only one or two application classes or unsuitable for strict-constrained resources. In view of a variety of WSN applications, there is a need of developing a self-adaptable and self-configurable embedded real-time operating system (RTOS). This paper presents a resource-aware and low-power RTOS termed LIMOS. This kernel adopts a component-based three-level system architecture: action (system operation), thread (component) and event (container). In accordance, a predictable and deterministic two-level scheduling mechanism is proposed: 'non pre-emption priority based' high level scheduling for events and 'preemptive priority-based' low level scheduling for threads. Employing the concepts of LINDA language, LIMOS provides a simplified tuple space and a light IN/OUT system primitive-pair to achieve system communication and synchronization. LIMOS is capable of self-adapting to run on two operation modes: event-driven and multi-threading, with respect to the application diversity. The performance evaluation and comparison shows LIMOS has tiny resource consumption and is fit for the real-time applications. Currently LIMOS has been ported on several hardware platforms for different WSN applications. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks are characterized by resource constraints. Therefore, today's sensor networks are implemented from scratch emphasizing code efficiency. This development strategy leads to relatively complex code and bad code reusability in further projects. To improve reusability and development efficiency, it is state-of-the-art in the development of standard information systems to divide applications into at least two parts, the application-logic, providing all the functions to solve a given problem and a reusable distributed middleware providing a container for the application. After developing the middleware once, the developer of further projects need to focus only on the application-logic. Thereby, the development times can be reduced considerably. However, a generic middleware layer replacing code implemented from scratch is not practicable in sensor networks due to resource constraints. Within this paper, we will present a model-driven approach in combination with a template-based code generator to get the best of both development strategies. This approach enables us to generate a tailored middleware for our application including interface-stubs for the application-logic. In contrast to other component-based approaches, the templates can be adopted easily to fulfill specific platform needs. We will demonstrate the practicability of this approach by implementing the control of a model railway. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Component-based architectures are the traditional approach to reconcile application specific optimization with reusable abstractions in sensor networks. However, they frequently overwhelm the application designer with the range of choices in component selection and composition. We introduce a component framework that reduces this complexity. It provides a well-defined content-based publish/subscribe service, but allows the application designer to adapt the service by making orthogonal choices about: (1) the communication protocol components for subscription and notification delivery, (2) the supported data attributes and (3) a set of service extension components. We present TinyCOPS, our implementation of the framework in TinyOS 2.0, and demonstrate its advantages by showing experimental results for different application configurations on two sensor node platforms in a large-scale indoor testbed. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Building high performance analytical applications for data streams generated from sensors is a challenging software engineering problem. Such applications typically comprise a complex pipeline of processing components that capture, transform and analyze the incoming data stream. In addition, applications must provide high throughput, be scalable and easily modifiable so that new analytical components can be added with minimum effort. In this paper we describe the MeDICi Integration Framework (MIF), which is a middleware platform we have created to address these challenges. The MIF extends an open source messaging platform with a component-based API for integrating components into analytical pipelines. We describe the features and capabilities of the MIF, and show how it has been used to build a production analytical application for detecting cyber security attacks. The application was composed from multiple independently developed components using several different programming languages. The resulting application was able to process network sensor traffic in real time and provide insightful feedback to network analysts as soon as potential attacks were recognized.},

abstract={Current differential relays are now widely used for the protection of transmission feeders. Simplicity of operation and the ability to clearly discriminate internal and external faults ensures their popularity, particularly when digital communication systems are available. Increasing availability of digital communication systems creates tremendous opportunities for protection but the move to switched hierarchical communication networks has created problems for phasor synchronization. The solution is the Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS provides time synchronization to an accuracy of ±1 μs, this relates to a 50-Hz differential phasor error of 0.04°. Although the normal phasor error is insignificant, concerns remain about the temporary loss of the GPS time reference signal. The performance of the differential relay is investigated on the EMTDC simulator for the loss of the GPS time reference signal. This paper presents a technique to cope with such a scenario using symmetrical component analysis and discusses how an adaptive bias can be used to maintain system stability. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Flooding is a growing problem, which affects more than 10% of the U.K. population. The cost of damage caused by flooding correlates closely with the warning time given before a flood event, making flood monitoring and prediction critical to minimizing the cost of flood damage. This paper describes a wireless sensor network (WSN) for flood warning, which is capable of not only integrating with remote fixed-network grids for computationally intensive flood modelling purposes but also performing on-site grid computation. This functionality is supported by the reflective and component-based GridKit middleware, which provides support for both WSN and grid application domains. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={A novel dynamic power management (DPM) algorithm is proposed for the sensor node of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), in which the sleeping threshold of each node in sleeping status is deduced theoretically and the probability of event arrival is investigated using Possion distribution on the basis of the event arrival processing model. Furthermore, on the premise of no effect on performance of WSNs, the M-duplicate-covered concept is introduced to abstract the cover redundancy in WSNs, and the characteristics of each sleep state of sensor node are analyzed. Based on these researches, the conditions of entering or escaping a state and the time interval of keeping the state are analyzed. Finally, we propose three asynchronous awakening schemes so that each node is free to power on or off its components based on the statistics. The simulation results show that the DPM algorithm can dynamically regulate the sleep depth of nodes while satisfying the network performances, reduce about 28% of the energy consumption and about 37% switching latency of DPM, and increase about 52% of the success ratio of switching, thereby the sensor nodes lifetime as well as the WSNs' lifetime is effectively improved.},

abstract={We describe how we use Lustre to build global and accurate executable models of energy consumption in sensor networks, intended to be used for both simulations and formal validation. One of the key ideas is to build a component-based global model, in such a way that various abstractions of the same model can be derived by unplugging a component and plugging a more abstract (or more detailed) one. This ability to play with various abstractions that can be formally compared with one another is essential for a virtual prototyping approach connected to formal validation tools. We comment on the properties of Lustre and its development environment that make this approach feasible. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper describes network middleware for distributed sensors in the home environment. The feature of the middleware is automatic connection of sensor data processing components without a fixed script. The connections of components are not directly fixed but determined based on existing components in the middleware when the components are deployed. The individual component reconnects to the target components with a condition that represents abstract sensor properties related to the target components, when the configuration of components changes. The target components are discovered with not only sensor properties but also spatial properties of sensor-attached objects such as positions and volumes. Automatic connection based on sensor properties realizes adaptability of the component to many heterogeneous sensors and sensor layouts in the home environment. Reconfiguration in the middleware was successfully shown in experiments of a monitoring application for an occupant in our experimental environment (Sensing Room). © 2008 VSP.},

abstract={We present an approach to provide Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) facilities into Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN). WSNs are usually composed of a large number of low power sensors. They require a careful consumption of the available energy in order to prolong the lifetime of the network. From the security point of view, the overhead added to standard protocols must be as light as possible according to the required security level. Starting from the DESERT tool [14, 16, 25] which has been proposed for component-based software architectures, we derive a new framework that permits to dynamically enforce a set of properties of the sensors behavior. This is accomplished by an IDS specification that is automatically translated into few lines of code installed in the sensors. This realizes a distributed system that locally detects violation of the sensors interactions policies and is able to minimize the information sent among sensors in order to discover attacks across the network.},

abstract={Most of the current WSN research platforms are based on Mica nodes and TinyOS. However, they're difficult to integrate with the existing mature source codes and difficult to port to other platforms. These micro-controller based solutions are also quite weak to fulfill high performance tasks such as image processing and PAN coordination. Furthermore, the new invented nesC language also holdback its acceptance among industry application developers. Considering the above shortcomings, an ARM7 based powerful WSN research platform, named OpenWSN, is designed and implemented. OpenWSN adopts bus architecture to connect different modules in hardware design and uses layered OOD/OOP in software design. The component-based and service-based architecture makes it easy to integrate with current mature resources. The node has 32KB SRAM and up to 512 KB flash memory. It can run between ll-60MHz and using DMA to move data inside memory. These features enable OpenWSN run much faster than general Mica or Telos nodes. The power consumption is a bit higher than Mica's Atmegal28L solution because ARM7 processor consumes more energy than Atmegal28L micro processor. However, due to its high performance, OpenWSN node can finish more tasks and spend more time in sleep status. This in turn decreases the power consumption. The experiment verifies the solution and confirms OpenWSN ' s effectiveness in high performance applications such as vibration measurements.},

abstract={An integrated, autonomous stick-on computing platform is proposed, consisting of (i) the Peer-it stick-on, multi-sensor, multi-actuator computer hardware, (ii) the Peer-it component-based software framework, and (iii) the Peer-it profile markup language PeerML, supporting spontaneous interaction among such platforms. The platform implements Peer-to-Peer computing principles in a self-contained, miniaturized, universal and scalable way, giving raise for application scenarios where the real-world artefacts like e.g. machines, tools or appliances-literally every thing-equipped with Peer-it technology can operate in spontaneously interacting, goal-oriented ensembles. Technically, preferences (like capabilities and goals) and context (like time, geo-position, owner, environmental conditions, etc.) of peers are kept as a profile encoded in PeerML in the local memory of Peer-its, and carried along wherever they move in space. Once peers come into spatial proximity of each other, profiles are exchanged via wireless communication, and the "similarity" of preferences is analyzed. In the case of "matching" preferences, an associated application is notified on both peers. Besides a fully functional autonomous hardware platform integrating multiple sensors, actuator arrays and wireless communication technologies, the Peer-it stick-on computer, a low-memory footprint, OSGi compliant Peer-it software framework has been implemented. We demonstrate in a flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) scenario, how the Peer-it technology can improve over centralized FMSs with respect to fault tolerance, scalability, flexibility in reconfiguration, productivity and efficiency. © 2008.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems are networked, component-based, real-time systems that control and monitor the physical world. We need software architectures that limit fault-propagation across unreliable components. This paper introduces our Simplex reference model which is distinguished by: a Plant being controlled in an external context, a Machine performing the control, a Domain Model that estimates the Plant state, and the Safety Requirements that must be met. The Simplex reference model assists with constructing CPS architectures which limit fault-propagation. We present a representative case study to highlight the ideas behind the model and our particular decomposition. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The percentage of elderly and people with disabilities is increasing; consequently the demand for an independent living is gaining importance. This article focuses on the threefold composition that consists of automation, multimedia and assistive technology components. Based on studies of specific users' needs and best practice, a design for a demonstrative Slovenian smart home environment is presented. We propose an improved concept, where three evident segments are presented: automation segment, connecting segment (gateway) and the Internet segment. Furthermore we present the architecture of the concept, where the elements of automation are defined, integrated with the assistive technologies and services, based on the broadband Internet connection. The aim of the designed smart home environment is to introduce new possibilities of better quality of life and the level of independence to the potential users in Slovenia, provided by the combined modern technologies, above all, the information and communication technologies. With the demonstrative smart home we plan to promote and increase e-inclusion of people with disabilities and elderly into the information society. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={This paper considers the simulation of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using new approach. We present Sensoria, a fully fledged simulator for WSNs that has considerable differences to all other existing simulators. Sensoria is very powerful in simulating a range of small to large scale WSNs based on a simple and complete Graphical User Interface (GUI). Sensoria's GUI allows users to design various simulation scenarios and display the simulation results graphically with many formats. Sensoria is a component-based simulator and it can be easily reconfigured to adapt to different levels of simulation details and accuracy. We demonstrate the usage of Sensoria via studying many performance metrics of a set of simple and flat routing protocols that are customized by Sensoria. The paper concludes with evidence that, albeit being simple and ease-of-use, Sensoria proves to be efficient and effective tool for WSN research purposes. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network (WSN) applications sense events in-situ and compute results in-network. Their software components should run on platforms with stringent constraints on node resources. Developers often design their programs by trial-and-error with a view to meeting these constraints. Through numerous iterations, they manually measure and estimate how far the programs cannot fulfill the requirements, and make adjustments accordingly. Such manual process is time-consuming and error-prone. Automated support is necessary. Based on an existing task view that treats a WSN application as tasks and models resources as constraints, we propose a new component view that associates components with code optimization techniques and constraints. We develop algorithms to synthesize components running on nodes, fulfilling the constraints, and thus optimizing their quality. We evaluate our proposal by a simulation study adapted from a real-life WSN application. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The software that runs on a typical wireless sensor network node must address a variety of constraints that are imposed by its purpose and implementation platform. Examples of such constraints include real-time behavior, highly limited RAM and ROM, and other scarce resources. These constraints lead to crosscutting concerns for the implementations of sensor network software: that is, all parts of the software must be carefully written to respect its resource constraints. Neither traditional languages (such as C) nor component-based languages (such as nesC) for implementing sensor network software allow programmers to deal with crosscutting resource constraints in a modular fashion. In this paper we describe Aspect nesC (ANesC), a language we are now implementing to help programmers modularize the implementations of crosscutting concerns within sensor network software. Aspect nesC extends nesC, a component-based dialect of C, with constructs for aspect-oriented programming. In addition to combining the ideas of components and aspects in a single language, ANesC will provide specific and novel constructs for resource-management concerns. For instance, pointcuts can identify program points at which the run-time stack is about to be exhausted or a real-time deadline has been missed. Corrective actions can be associated with these points via "advice." A primary task of the Aspect nesC compiler is to implement such resource-focused aspects in an efficient manner.

abstract={Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are a very promising research field since they find application in many different areas. Current proposals for WSN system development are mainly focused on implementation issues and they rarely rely on a Software Engineering methodology which supports their entire development life-cycle. The Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach can contribute to solve this problem by allowing designers to model their systems at different abstraction levels, providing them with automatic model transformations to incrementally refine abstract models into more concrete ones. In this vein, this paper presents a MDE approach to WSN application development. Three levels of abstraction have been defined which allow designers to build: (1) domain-specific models, (2) component-based architecture descriptions, and (3) platform-specific models. Automatic model transformations between these three abstraction levels have been designed and, in order to demonstrate the viability of the proposal, a real WSN application has been developed using the implemented tools. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={The diverse requirements of wireless sensor network applications necessitate the development of multiple media access control (MAC) protocols to meet their varying throughput, latency, and network lifetime needs. Building new MAC protocols has proven to be extremely difficult, however, given the monolithic nature of existing protocol implementations as well as their dependence on a particular radio or processor platform. To address these issues, we propose the MAC Layer Architecture (MLA), a componentbased architecture for power-efficient MAC protocol development in wireless sensor networks. MLA consists of optimized, reusable components that implement a common set of features shared by existing MAC protocols, as well as abstractions that encapsulate the intricacies of the hardware platforms they run on. Through an instantiation of MLA in TinyOS 2.0.1, we have implemented five representative MAC protocols. Empirical results show that MLA results in significant code reuse among different protocols, while achieving comparative performance and memory footprints to monolithic implementations of the same protocols.

abstract={Most of the current WSN research platforms are based on Mica nodes and TinyOS. However, it's difficult to be integrated with the obsolete mature source code and difficult to port to other platforms. The micro-controller based solution is also weak to take high performance tasks such as image processing. So we develope an ARM7 based powerful WSN research platform named OpenWSN. OpenWSN adopts layer-first component based architecture. The hierachical feature makes it much easier to port to other hardware platforms. And OpenWSN introduces object oriented design and C language for implementation, which can make full use of the current mature source codes and human resources to lower the cost of future developing. Some more techniques are also introduced such as static resource allocation and service based policy to increase its robustness for real application. In general, OpenWSN is an appropriate solution for both industry and academia.},

abstract={Although Wireless Sensor Network applications share a common set of limitations (e.g. resource scarcity and lossy radio communication models) a basic set of runtime services (e.g. routing, time synchronization, and code dissemination), applications are often designed in an adhoc fashion, reducing the amount of code reuse, making a component-based software engineering approach desirable. We present a micro service component model, entitled μSIC, that abstracts a sensor node as an entity that provides and uses services. This model is realized through the use of the μSIC runtime, a small and efficient Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) tailored for resource-constrained devices. The μSIC runtime can perform service-paging, a method of storing a service's state to flash memory and restoring it whenever the service is needed. Secondly, we provide a domain-specific language allowing applications to be expressed as a collection of services that run on top of the μSIC runtime and enables a multi-threaded programming model. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we consider performance characterizations of self-localization algorithms for sensor networks. The location parameters have a natural decomposition into relative configuration and centroid transformation components based on the influence of measurements and prior information in the problem. A linear representation of the transformation parameter space, which includes rotations and translations, is used for decomposition of general localization error covariance matrices. The proposed decomposition may be applied to any estimator, the posterior Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) in a Bayesian setting, or a traditional CRB. Along with the CRB itself, the relative-transformation decomposition provides insight into how external inputs effect absolute localization performance. This partitioning of error is also useful to higher level applications in a sensor network that utilize results of the localization service and must account for its uncertainty. Examples are presented and an application demonstrates the utility of relative error decomposition to the problem of angle-of-arrival estimation with sensor location uncertainty. ©2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Environmental monitoring using of sensors network seems to be a significant alternative of current detection techniques for a huge and critical problem in the Mediterranean area : wildfires. However, we don't know the real capacity and reliability of this particular tool under special conditions. Modelling and simulation appear like an essential aspect to understand the behavior of this special network. Discrete Event system Specification (DEVS) formalism is able to describe the asynchronous nature of the events occuring in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In this paper we introduce a DEVS sensor model with a particular focus on network management. We decide to describe a node by components-based approach and to provide a simulation tool with a focus on two main characteristics : modularity of components and the environnemental interactions. Our model with a detailled definition of components of WSNnode can bring some responses to routing techniques. This first step in simulation and analysis of results confirm utility, capacity and modular aspect of our model to represent a large number of nodes and specific characteristics of WSN in critical environmental conditions.},

abstract={Recently, research interest has increased in the design, development, and deployment of mobile agent systems for high-level inference and surveillance in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Mobile agent systems employ migrating codes to facilitate flexible application re-tasking, local processing, and collaborative signal and information processing. This provides extra flexibility, as well as new capabilities to WSNs in contrast to the conventional WSN operations based on the client-server computing model. In this article we survey the potential applications of mobile agents in WSNs and discuss the key design issues for such applications. We decompose the agent design functionality into four components, that is, architecture, itinerary planning, middleware system design, and agent cooperation. This taxonomy covers low-level to high-level design issues and facilitates the creation of a component-based and efficient mobile agent system for a wide range of applications. With a different realization for each design component, it is expected that flexible trade-offs (e.g., between energy and delay) can be achieved according to specific application requirements. © 2007 IEEE.},

Related to this concept, Tecnalia Automoción has developed a prototype of a sensorized active headrest to be placed maintaining desired horizontal and vertical safety distances to head and without pyrotechnical actuators which can cause injuries to the user. With the implementation of AmI based solutions like described above, the number of car sensors and actuators will grow up drastically, and more efficient control architectures will be needed. For this, Tecnalia Automoción is designing a networked solution with smart sensors and actuators integrating the IEEE 1451 standard group, initially to be applied to active headrest prototype. IEEE 1451 is a group of seven standards, some of them in revision phase, about smart transducers interface for sensors and actuators that they will let us to have more features in sensor-actuator side.},

abstract={This paper introduces a component-based network management system for wireless sensor networks. The research is motivated by a variety of problems that occur due to the unpredictable behavior of wireless sensor networks. Once sensor nodes are deployed, the inner behavior of a sensor field can only be analyzed by monitoring incoming data packets at the sink node or base station, if only such a framework exists. In this paper, we present a component-based management system, RMTool, which allows developers to easily monitor and analyze the network status and interactively configure the network over unexpected problems while running applications over it. The system has been implemented on a multi-threaded sensor network operating system RETOS, which supports run-time loadable kernel modules. The preliminary evaluation shows that RMTool provides management functionalities as designed, and the implementation is efficient due to the component-based module architecture. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={New automated, application-independent methodology for designing and deploying sensor networks Following this book's clear explanations, examples, and illustrations, domain experts can design and deploy nontrivial networked sensing applications without much knowledge of the low-level networking aspects of deployment. This new approach is based on the Abstract Task Graph (ATaG), a data-driven programming model and an innovative methodology forarchitecture-independent programming and automatic software synthesis for sensor networks. ATaG programs are concise, understandable, and network-independent descriptions of global application functionality that can be automatically compiled onto any target deployment. The book begins with an overview chapter that addresses the important issues of programming methodologies and compares various programming models for sensor networks. Next, the authors set forth everything you need for designing and deploying sensor networks using ATaG, including: Detailed description of the ATaG model's features System-level support for architecture-independent programming Examination of the graphical programming and software synthesis environment for ATaG Case study illustrating the process of end-to-end application development and software synthesis using ATaG Throughout the book, the authors provide code excerpts and figures to help clarify key concepts and explain each step. For programmers, the graphical formalism of the ATaG program, coupled with the fact it uses an existing language (Java), means that no special training is needed to start developing and deploying applications in ATaG. Everything you need to know is clearly set forth in this book. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={It is currently difficult to build practical and reliable programming systems out of distributed and resource-constrained sensor devices. The state of the art in today's sensornet programming is centered around a component-based language called nesC. nesC is a node-level language-a program is written for an individual node in the network-and nesC programs use the services of an operating system called TinyOS. We are pursuing an approach to programming sensor networks that significantly raises the level of abstraction over this practice. The critical change is one of perspective: rather than writing programs from the point of view of an individual node, programmers implement a central program that conceptually has access to the entire network. This approach pushes to the compiler the task of producing node-level programs that implement the desired behavio. We present the Pleiades programming language, its compiler, and its runtime. The Pleiades language extends the C language with constructs that allow programmers to name and access node-local state within the network and to specify simple forms of concurrent execution. The compiler and runtime system cooperate to implement Pleiades programs efficiently and reliably. First, the compiler employs a novel program analysis to translate Pleiades programs into message-efficient units of work implemented in nesC. The Pleiades runtime system orchestrates execution of these units, using TinyOS services, across a network of sensor nodes. Second, the compiler and runtime system employ novel locking, deadlock detection, and deadlock recovery algorithms that guarantee serializability in the face of concurrent execution. We illustrate the readability, reliability and efficiency benefits of the Pleiades language through detailed experiments, and demonstrate that the Pleiades implementation of a realistic application performs similar to a hand-coded nesC version that contains more than ten times as much code.

abstract={iStuff Mobile is the first rapid prototyping framework that helps explore new sensor-based interfaces with existing mobile phones. It focuses on sensor-enhanced physical interfaces for ubiquitous computing scenarios. The framework includes sensor network platforms, mobile phone software, and a proven rapid prototyping framework. Interaction designers can use iStuff Mobile to quickly create and test functional prototypes of novel interfaces without making internal hardware or software modifications to the handset. A visual programming paradigm provides a low threshold for prototyping activities: the system is not difficult to learn. At the same time, the range of examples built using the toolkit demonstrates a high ceiling for prototyping activities: the toolkit places few limits on prototype complexity. A user study shows that the visual programming metaphor enables prototypes to be built faster and encourages more iterations than a previous approach. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

abstract={Sensor networks, ad-hoc networking and supporting infrastructure (e.g. middleware) are major building blocks for pervasive computing and pervasive services. Our experience has made it clear that sensor networks, and in particular our flock sensor network, have scarce support for application development needs. To provide for rapid development of pervasive services based on ingested sensor data from sensor networks we have developed both a sensor network and an accompanying infrastructure support (e.g. middleware). The sensor network protocols have been designed to meet the disconnection and power consumption requirements often found as a result of intrinsic properties of mobile sensor networks. Existing (enterprise) middleware platforms have severe limitations for the creation of services that need access to for example the local file system or external/local sensors. The component based programming model imposed by such middleware systems has however proven itself useful for the production of service oriented applications. We have created a container based middleware platform, similar to enterprise middleware systems but without their limitations. This platform makes it easier to create pervasive, service oriented, applications possibly based on data from sensor networks. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are a very promising research field since they are applicable in many different areas. Current proposals for WSN system development are mainly focused on implementation issues and rarely use a Software Engineering methodology to support their development life cycle. The Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach can be used as a solution to this by allowing designers to model their systems at different abstraction levels, providing them with automatic model transformations to incrementally refine abstract models into more concrete ones. In this vein, this paper presents an MDE approach to WSN application development. Three levels of abstraction have been defined which allow designers to build: (1) domain-specific models, (2) component-based architecture descriptions, and (3) platform-specific models. Automatic model transformations between these three abstraction levels have been designed and, in order to demonstrate the viability of the proposal, a real WSN application has been developed using the implemented tools. © World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This paper considers the accuracy of sensor node location estimates from self-calibration in sensor networks. The location parameters are shown to have a natural decomposition into relative configuration and centroid transformation components based on the influence of measurements and prior information in the problem. A linear representation of the transformation parameter space, which includes rotations and translations, is shown to coincide with the nullspace of the unconstrained Fisher information matrix (FIM). To regularize the absolute localization problem, we consider constraints on the coordinate locations and the impact of these constraints on relative and absolute location error. A geometric interpretation of the constrained Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is provided based on the principal angles between the measurement subspace and the constraint subspace. Examples illustrate the utility of this error decomposition. © 2007 IEEE.},

This software framework can accommodate the management of lifecycle data at all stages, especially data that occur in distribution, usage, maintenance and end-of-life stages, and use them to provide information and knowledge. The software framework is built with software components, based on a component-based concept with reference to a product lifecycle information acquisition and management model proposed within this research study. Two actual lifecycle information management systems are created using the Framework in field trials. This software framework can open new horizons for product design which are sustainable and environmentally sensitive.

abstract={Due to resource constraints, digital image transmission is a significant challenge to the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) using image sensors. Wavelet based compression provides coefficient information with different importance levels for image reconstruction, which are desirable for multirate transmission over WSN with energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel multirate image transmission approach, Image Component Multirate Transmission (ICMT), over WSN by applying different reliable levels of transmission adaptive to various components within the compressed image bit stream. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve high energy efficiency in WSN while enhancing the image transmission quality considerably on noisy channels.},

abstract={It is currently dif.cult to build practical and reliable programming systems out of distributed and resource-constrained sensor devices. The state of the art in today's sensornet programming is centered around a component-based language called nesC. nesC is a nodelevel language - a program is written for an individual node in the network- and nesC programs use the services of an operating system called TinyOS. We are pursuing an approach to programming sensor networks that signi.cantly raises the level of abstraction over this practice. The critical change is one of perspective: rather than writing programs from the point of view of an individual node, programmers implement a central program that conceptually has access to the entire network. This approach pushes to the compiler the task of producing node-level programs that implement the desired behavior. We present the Pleiades programming language, its compiler, and its runtime. The Pleiades language extends the C language with constructs that allow programmers to name and access node-local state within the network and to specify simple forms of concurrent execution. The compiler and runtime system cooperate to implement Pleiades programs ef.ciently and reliably. First, the compiler employs a novel program analysis to translate Pleiades programs into message-ef.cient units of work implemented in nesC. The Pleiades runtime system orchestrates execution of these units, using TinyOS services, across a network of sensor nodes. Second, the compiler and runtime system employ novel locking, deadlock detection, and deadlock recovery algorithms that guarantee serializability in the face of concurrent execution. We illustrate the readability, reliability and ef.ciency bene.ts of the Pleiades language through detailed experiments, and demonstrate that the Pleiades implementation of a realistic application performs similar to a hand-coded nesC version that contains more than ten times as much code. © 2007 ACM.},

abstract={Environmental monitoring using of sensors network seems to be a significant alternative of current detection techniques for a huge and critical problem in the Mediterranean area : wildfires. However, we don't know the real capacity and reliability of this particular tool under special conditions. Modelling and simulation appear like an essential aspect to understand the behavior of this special network. Discrete Event system Specification (DEVS) formalism is able to describe the asynchronous nature of the events occuring in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In this paper we introduce a DEVS sensor model with a particular focus on network management. We decide to describe a node by components-based approach and to provide a simulation tool with a focus on two main characteristics : modularity of components and the environnemental interactions. Our model with a detailled definition of components of WSNnode can bring some responses to routing techniques. This first step in simulation and analysis of results confirm utility, capacity and modular aspect of our model to represent a large number of nodes and specific characteristics of WSN in critical environmental conditions.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate strategies for radio power control for wireless sensor networks that guarantee a desired packet error probability. Efficient power control algorithms are of major concern for these networks, not only because the power consumption can be significantly decreased but also because the interference can be reduced, allowing for higher throughput. An analytical model of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which is link quality metric, is proposed. The model relates the RSSI to the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR), and thus provides a connection between the powers and the packet error probability. Two power control mechanisms are studied: a Multiplicative-Increase Additive-Decrease (MIAD) power control described by a Markov chain, and a power control based on the average packet error rate. A component-based software implementation using the Contiki operating system is provided for both the power control mechanisms. Experimental results are reported for a test-bed with Telos motes. © 2007 EUCA.},

abstract={Component-based techniques revolve around composable, reusable software objects that shield the application level software from the details of the hardware and lowlevel software implementation and vice versa. Components provide many benefits that have led to their wide adoption in software and middleware developed for embedded systems. They are well-defined entities that can be replaced without affecting the rest of the systems, they can be developed and tested reparately and integrated later, and they are reusable. Clearly such features are important of the design of large-scale complex systems more generally, beyond software architectures. We propose the use of a component approach to address embedded control problems. WE outline a general component-based framework to embedded control and show how it can be instantiated in specific problems that arise in the control over/of sensor networks. Building on the middleware component framework developed under the European project RUNES, we develop a number of control-oriented components necessary for the implementation of control applications and design their integration. The paper provides the overview of the approach, discuss a real life application where the approach has been tested and outlines a number of specific control problems that arise in this application. © 2007 EUCA.},

abstract={Distributed wireless sensor networks (WSN) are being proposed for various applications including defense, security, and smart stages. The introduction of hardware wireless sensors in a signal processing education setting can serve as a paradigm for data acquisition, collaborative signal processing, or simply as a platform for obtaining, processing, and analyzing real-life real-time data. In this paper, we present a software interface that enables the Java-DSP (J-DSP) visual programming environment to communicate in a two-way manner with a wireless sensor network. This interface was developed by writing nesC code that enables J-DSP to issue commands to multiple wireless sensor motes, activate specific transducers, and analyze data using any of the existing J-DSP signal processing functions in real time. A series of exercises were developed to provide hardware experiences to signals and systems and DSP undergraduate students. The interface, the exercises, and some preliminary assessment results are discussed in the paper. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays there is a trend in distributed systems research of applying software engineering and open standards in the development of large, robust and easily configurable systems, where the basic unit of replacement is the software component. Literature in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), a recently emerging technology, shows on the contrary, an abolition of these techniques as a response to the strong restrictions imposed by the hardware. Therefore, the current software created for WSN has features of the long time ago software: monolithic and platform dependent. This work studies the current state of the art in WSN and Model Driven Architecture (MDA), a standard used to drive the development of large distributed systems. The most important contribution of this paper is fusing both into an initial version of a feasible component-based middleware addressing the major challenges in WSN. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper characterizes two ad hoc routing protocols LAR and DSDV for sensor area networking on TinyOS. To the best of our knowledge no such comparison of these selected protocols is being made on TinyOS, an event driven component based operating system for embedded sensor networks. Energy utilization in mobile ad hoc networks or sensor networks is a major concern. Minimizing energy in terms of payload, battery power, CPU and memory utilization at a node are important factors that decide the potential of a routing scheme. This paper presents the comparison of the mentioned protocols on the basis of energy being consumed by the whole network. The scenario considered was the one in which the whole information was gathered at one node, i.e., the base station or the sink node of the network. Results indicate that LAR performs better than DSDV. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work we propose a traffic management mechanism to support real-time flows in highly unpredictable sensor network environments. The mechanism is based on a joint traffic regulation and end-to-end scheduling approach; a traffic regulation component adjusts the incoming packet rate to implicitly control the channel load and intelligently rejects packets that are more likely to miss their deadline while a laxity-based scheduling component projects the packets' per-hop delay and compensates for network end-to-end delays. Thus, high success ratios without severely degrading the fidelity are achieved. Our mechanism attempts to maintain accuracy in a resource-efficient manner even under extremely unstable network conditions where delays are difficult to model and compute. Furthermore, the adoption of a component-based approach allows for substantial independence from both the MAC and routing layers. We thoroughly evaluate our mechanism and demonstrate its accuracy and performance merits. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a novel component-based approach to hardware/software co-verification of embedded systems using model checking. Due to their diverse applications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems are increasingly component-based and include only the necessary components for their missions. In our approach, a component model for embedded systems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardware components) and software components is defined. Hardware and software components are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systems are co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions of bottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verification complexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verification reuse. Case studies on a suite of networked sensors have shown that our approach facilitates major verification reuse and leads to order-of-magnitude reduction on verification complexity. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes automatic generation and linking mechanism of sensor processing components, which are called sensor services, in network middleware for distributed sensors in room. This mechanism reduces deployment process in creation of applications for real sensorized environments. The mechanism consists of 1) dynamic program duplication triggered by matching generation condition with descriptions of components and 2) sensor data selection based on selection conditions and the descriptions. The description, which is called RDF sensor description, is written in Resource Description Framework (RDF) for definition of sensor properties including the knowledge about sensor-attached object. The conditions for RDF sensor description are scripted flexibly with vocabulary of abstract sensor knowledge. Through the conditions, the components are generated dynamically according to change of the sensor composition. The generated components can select needed sensor data in multiple sensor environment. We create sensor services that detect certain behaviors from raw sensor data in our Sensing Room. The services show generation mechanism's independency on configurations of sensors in deployment of the components in the middleware. ©2006 IEEE.},

abstract={We present an approach to provide Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) facilities into Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN). WSNs are usually composed of a large number of low power sensors. They require a careful consumption of the available energy in order to prolong the lifetime of the network. From the security point of view, the overhead added to standard protocols must be as light as possible according to the required security level. Starting from the DESERT tool [2] which has been proposed for component-based software architectures, we derive a new framework that permits to dynamically enforce a set of properties of the sensors behavior. This is accomplished by an IDS specification that is automatically translated into few lines of code installed in the sensors. This realizes a distributed system that locally detects violation of the sensors interactions policies and is able to minimize the information sent among sensors in order to discover attacks over the network. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks have gained considerable attention in the past few years. They have found application domains in battlefield communication, homeland security, pollution sensing, and traffic monitoring. As such, there has been an increasing need to define and develop simulation frameworks for carrying out high-fidelity WSN simulation. In this article we present a modeling, simulation, and emulation framework for WSNs in J-Sim - an open source, component-based compositional network simulation environment developed entirely in Java. This framework is built on the autonomous component: architecture and extensible internetworking framework of J-Sim, and provides an object-oriented definition of target, sensor, and sink nodes, sensor and wireless communication channels, and physical media such as seismic channels, mobility models, and power models (both energy-producing and energy-consuming components). Application-specific models can be defined by subclassing classes in the simulation framework and customizing their behaviors. We also include in J-Sim a set of classes and mechanisms to realize network emulation. We demonstrate the use of the proposed WSN simulation framework by implementing several well-known localization, geographic routing, and directed diffusion protocols, and perform performance comparisons (in terms of the execution time incurred and memory used) in simulating WSN scenarios in J-Sim and ns-2. The simulation study indicates the WSN framework in J-Sim is much more scalable than ns-2 (especially in memory usage). We also demonstrate the use of the WSN framework in carrying out real-life full-fledged Future Combat System (FCS) simulation and emulation. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={With the advancement in chip manufacturing, miniaturized sensors and wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies there is a demand for deploying smart micro-sensors for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. To meet the demand it is necessary to design flexible and adaptable methods for information access, distributing queries (queries generated by sink nodes to relevant sensor nodes that have observed interesting events in the network) and getting responses in a WSN. The paper proposes an agent based method to perform following: 1) generates an event path from the source node (where the event has occurred) to end node placed at either the adjacent or opposite boundaries of the area of WSN, 2) generate a query path from the sink node to discover an event by using an event path. The proposed method is simulated in various network scenarios and performance is analyzed in terms of successful real-time event (route to event) discovery and agent overheads. It is noticed that performance improved with more number of event paths. Agents offer flexible and adaptable services and also support component based software development.},

abstract={Distributed wireless sensor networks (WSN) are being proposed for various applications including defense, security, smart stages, and other. The introduction of hardware wireless sensors in a signal processing education setting can serve as a paradigm for data acquisition, collaborative signal processing or simply as a platform for obtaining, processing, and analyzing real-life real-time data. In this paper, we present a software interface that enables the Java-DSP (J-DSP) visual programming environment to communicate in a two-way manner with a wireless sensor network. This interface was developed by writing nesC code that enables J-DSP to issue commands to multiple wireless sensor motes, activate specific transducers, and analyze data using any of the existing J-DSP signal processing functions in real time. A series of exercises were developed to provide hardware experiences to signals and systems and DSP undergraduate students. The interface, the exercises, and some preliminary assessment results are discussed in the paper. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.},

abstract={The assumption of reliability of wireless sensor networks with the help of self-organizing routing algorithms are discussed. The self-recognizing routing algorithms are used to find an optimal way when one node in an active route is broken. The self-recognizing algorithms works when data is being transferred and a routing protocol should be employed to create a route first. TinyOS is an event-driven operating system intended for sensor networks with limited resource and is designed by researchers. It features a component based architecture which enables rapid innovation and implementation and minimizes code size to make constraint memory of sensor node work effectively. TOSSIM is a discrete event simulator for a TinyOS sensor network and builds directly from TinyOS code. Routing protocol can check network's integrity when it is in idle time and many ways have been provided to assure reliability.},

abstract={With the increasing complexity of the real-time embedded software, the power consumption is becoming a real challenge in the system designs. In this paper, for modelling the component-based embedded software, the interface automata is extended by adding time intervals on the actions and assigning energy consumption rates on the states. The extensional formalism is called energy interface automata. Then the system designs are modelled by energy interface automaton networks which consist of a set of energy interface automata synchronized by shared actions. Based on analyzing the integer state space of the energy interface automaton networks and its compatible reachiability graph, we develop two algorithms for the problem of the minimal energy consumption calculation and the maximal energy consumption verification respectively. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2006.},

abstract={Research in embedded networked sensing has primarily focused on the design of hardware architectures for sensor nodes and infrastructure protocols for long lived operation of resource constrained sensor network deployments, There is now an increasing interest in the programming aspects of sensor networks, especially in the broader context of pervasive computing. This paper provides a brief overview of ongoing research in programming of sensor networks and classifies it into layers of abstraction that provide the application developer with progressively higher level primitives to express distributed, phenomenon-centric collaborative computation. As a specific instance of a macroprogramming methodology, we discuss the data driven Abstract Task Graph (ATaG) model and the structure of its underlying runtime system. ATaG separates the application functionality from non-functional aspects, thereby enabling end-to-end architecture-independent programming and automatic software synthesis for a class of networked sensor systems. A prototype visual programming, software synthesis, functional simulation and visualization environment for ATaG has been implemented. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={Application reconfiguration provides a powerful mechanism to adapt component-based distributed applications for changed environmental conditions. In this paper, we propose an effective environment adaptive application reconfiguration (EAAR) mechanism based on the feedback-loop concept of the control theory. Based on this mechanism, a pull-based paradigm is introduced to represent the sensing-judging-acting process in sensor networks. We utilize rule-based knowledge to analyze the change of environment, thus perform self-adaptive application reconfiguration efficiently. To demonstrate how EAAR mechanism works, we simulated a scenario of reconfiguring applications in sensor networks. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={In this paper, we present the design methodology, and the software architecture, of J-Sim, an open-source network simulation/emulation environment that has been developed, in part, under the support of the NSF Next Generation Software program. We first give an overview of the component-based software architecture, called the autonomous component architecture (ACA), that is used as the underlying architecture for J-Sim. Then we describe how we lay a generalized packetbased network simulation framework, called Extensible Internetworking Framework (INET), on top of ACA. Both the ACA and the INET have been implemented in Java. The resulting codes, along with an essential suite of network protocols and compoents (for the Internet best-effort/integrated services/differentiated services architecture) its extension for wireless and sensor networks, and a scripting framework and GUI interfaces, is called J-Sim. To demonstrate the composability and extensibility of J-Sim, we elaborate on how we model in J-Sim several different network architectures, namely the Differentiated Services (diffserv) architecture, the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) architecture, and the wireless sensor network architecture.},

abstract={A high adaptable middleware has been an essential platform to provide more flexible services for multimedia, mobile, and ubiquitous applications in ubiquitous computing environments. In addition, the persistent services of these application systems and their middleware in ubiquitous computing are required so that they can be aware of the frequent and unpredictable changes in users' requirements as well as environmental conditions and adapt their behavioural changes. However, current approaches for supporting adaptability have made applications themselves trigger and execute an adaptive mechanism when the underling infrastructure notifies them about any changes. In this paper, we propose a novel component-based context-adaptive model for context-awareness middleware to support efficiently dynamic adaptation of application services. We also demonstrate the current implementation of the context-adaptive middleware that help applications to adapt their ubiquitous computing environments according to rapidly changing contexts such as user-specific preferences, application-specific preferences, and low-level configurations. © IMP International Federation for Information Processing 2005.},

abstract={We design a "two-layered" dynamic power management strategy in our sensor node to reduce the power consumption. There are many factors such as the probability of event generation, the battery status, the coverage problem, and the communication situations in our consideration. In network communication, we propose an asynchronous awakening scheme so that each node is free to power on or off its components based on the observed event statistics, and make a trade-off between communication and power consumption. The deepest sleep state period is determined by taking account of the residual power. Combining with these methods, the lifetime of the sensor node can be extended as longer as possible without influencing the system performance. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={The increasing pervasiveness of wide-area distributed computing resources, like computational Grids, has given rise to applications that have inherent problems of complexity, adaptability, dynamism and heterogeneity etc. The emerging concept of autonomic computing holds the key to the self-management of such a multifarious undertaking and provides a way to further build upon this complexity without incurring additional drawbacks. Furthermore, access to Grid services at present is generally limited to devices having substantial computing, network and memory resources whereas most of mobile devices do not have the sufficient capabilities to be either direct clients or services in the Grid environment. The existing middleware platforms like Globus do not fully address mobility, yet extending the potential of the Grid to a wider audience promises increase in its flexibility and productivity. In this paper 1, we present a component-based autonomic middleware that can handle the complexity of extending the potential of the Grid to a wider mobile audience, by incorporating the features of context-awareness and self-management. We also address the middleware issues of job delegation to a Grid service, support for disconnected operation/offline processing and secure communication. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2005.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have gained considerable attention in the past few years. As such, there has been an increasing need for defining and developing simulation frameworks for carrying out high-fidelity WSN simulation. In this paper, we present a modeling and simulation framework for WSNs in J-Sim - an open-source, component-based compositional network simulation environment that is developed entirely in Java. This framework is built upon the autonomous component architecture (ACA) and the extensible internetworking framework (INET) of J-Sim, and provides an object-oriented definition of (i) target, sensor and sink nodes, (ii) sensor and wireless communication channels, and (in) physical media such as seismic channels, mobility model and power model (both energy-producing and energy-consuming components). Application-specific models can be defined by sub-classing classes in the simulation framework and customizing their behaviors. We demonstrate the use of the proposed WSN simulation framework by implementing several well-known localization, geographic routing, and directed diffusion protocols. In addition, we perform performance comparisons (in terms of execution time incurred, and the memory used) in simulating several typical WSN scenarios in J-Sim and ns-2. The simulation study indicates that the proposed WSN simulation framework in J-Sim is much more scalable than ns-2 (especially in memory usage). © 2005 IEEE.},

Smart Items are physical objects with sensing, computing and communication capabilities based on RFID techniques. Enterprise services are generic services that can be tailored to an industry's or a company's specific needs. Examples include accounting, health care, financing, supply chain management, oil and gas, consumer goods, automotive industry and many other domains. However, bringing these two emerging technologies together is not obvious and may become quite cumbersome. There are challenging modeling issues that need to be addressed. In this article, we will present our overall approach to discuss solutions for these challenging questions. We will then demonstrate our concepts along a case study that we have performed on the UC Berkeley sensor boards, (so called motes) for the domain of container security. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={Component-based design has become a necessity for networked embedded systems where hardware platforms come in a great variety and evolve extremely rapidly. Operating system components and higher level middleware services call for modular software construction along clear interfaces. The way we describe these interfaces and process the captured information is of crucial importance for exploiting the benefits of component-based design. In this paper we present a model based approach to the development of embedded applications with a special emphasis on interface specification. The proposed formalism captures the temporal and type aspects of interfaces and supports the composition and verification of components. Along with the formal definition of the proposed interface language and component compatibility rules, we present a modeling environment targeting TinyOS, a representative embedded operating system. Two prototype tools are also described that check the composability of components based on their interface models and verify that the implementation of a component matches its formal model, respectively. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Wireless sensor networks have attracted much research effort in the past five years. With TinyOS, there exists a widely used, microthreaded operating system targeted for single processor sensor nodes. It requires only minimal processing and memory resources. Many research activities in the wireless sensor area focus on the design of efficient protocols in the MAC and network layer. SDL - a high-abstraction level formal description language - has long been used for modeling, simulation, and verification of communication protocols. In this paper, we present a mapping approach and optimizations to derive efficient component-based event-driven TinyOS applications from SDL models. We show, how the basic SDL concepts are reflected in the TinyOS component architecture.},

abstract={Novel ubiquitous computing applications such as intelligent vehicles, smart buildings, and traffic management require special properties that traditional computing applications do not support, such as context-awareness, massive decentralisation, autonomous behaviour, adaptivity, proactivity, and innate collaboration. This paper presents a new computational model and middleware that reflect support for the required the properties. The sentient object model is proposed by the CORTEX1 project to support the construction of ubiquitous applications. A flexible, run-time reconfigurable component-based middleware has been built to provide run-time support to engineer the sentient object programming paradigm. An application infrastructure using sentient objects to enable cooperation between autonomous and proactive vehicles has been implemented to demonstrate the appropriateness of the computational model and the validity of the middleware for pervasive mobile ad hoc computing.

abstract={Although component-based software development has widespread acceptance in the enterprise business and desktop application domains, developers of distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems have encountered limitations with the available component middleware platforms, such as the CORBA Component Model (CCM) and the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE). These limitations often preclude developers of DRE systems from fully exploiting the benefits of component software. In particular, component middleware platforms lack standards-based publisher/subscriber communication mechanisms that support key quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, such as low latency, bounded jitter, and end-to-end operation priority propagation. QoS-enabled publisher/subscriber services are available in object middleware platforms, such as Real-time CORBA, but such services have not been integrated into component middleware due to a number of development and configuration challenges. This paper provides three contributions to the integration of publisher/subscriber services in component middleware. First, we outline key challenges associated with integrating publisher/subscriber services into component middleware. Second, we describe a methodology for resolving these challenges based on software patterns. Third, we describe a pattern-oriented component middleware platform that we have developed to integrate publisher/subscriber services into component middleware applications. Copyright 2004 ACM.},

abstract={The geographic context is essential both for environmental research and for policy-oriented environmental management. Geographic information systems are as a result increasingly important computing applications in this domain, and an understanding of the underlying principles of geographic information science is increasingly essential to sound scientific practice. The review begins by defining terms. Four major sections follow that discuss advances in GIS analysis and modeling, in the supply of geographic data for GIS, in software design, and in GIS representation. GIS-based modeling is constrained in part by architecture, but a number of recent products show promise, and GIS continues to support modeling through the coupling of software. The GIS data supply has benefited from a range of new satellite-based sensors and from developments in ground-based sensor networks. GIS software design is being revolutionized by two developments in the information technology mainstream: the trend to component-based software and object-oriented data modeling. Advances in GIS representation focus largely on time, the third spatial dimension, and uncertainty. References are provided to the more important and recent literature. The concluding section identifies three significant and current trends: toward increasing interoperability of data and services, increasing mobility of information technology, and increasing capabilities for dynamic simulation.},

In this paper we introduce the design of a framework based on components to develop embedded real-time control and automation systems. The basis platforms are the Linux/RT operating system and the embedded system TINI (tiny Internet interfaces) from Dallas semiconductor. The TINI is used as an embedded interface to an automation and control intelligent sensor network application and the Linux/RT is used to implement the real-time server front-end.

abstract={The ongoing miniaturization and cost reduction in the sector of electronic hardware has created ample opportunity for equipping private households with inexpensive smart devices for controlling and automating various tasks in our daily lives. Networking technology and standards have an important role in driving this development. The omnipresence of the Internet via phone lines, TV cable, power lines, and wireless channels facilitates ubiquitous networks of smart devices that will significantly change the way we interact with home appliances. Home networking is foreseen to become one of the fastest growing markets in the area of information technology. However, interoperability and flexibility of embedded devices are key challenges for making smart home technology accessible to a broad audience. In particular, the software programs that determine the behavior of the smart home must facilitate customizability and extensibility. Unlike industrial applications, typically engineered by highly skilled programmers, control and automation programs for the smart home should be understandable by laypeople. In this article we discuss how recent technological progress in the areas of visual programming languages, component software, and connection-based programming can be applied to programming the smart home. As an example of an industrial prototype solution, we present microCommander, a visual tool for rapidly programming synergetic devices for the smart home.},

abstract={We discuss our approach to constructing a dynamic and secure smart home environment and tackling the challenges associated with it. We envision a smart home as an active environment populated with smart, dynamically configurable consumer devices capable of interacting with humans and other smart devices. In such a dynamic and active environment, there is a great need for an agile, lightweight, distributed security mechanism. This security mechanism needs to be programmable and able to evolve as rapidly as the environment itself. Yet, this mechanism should be able to adapt to environments with scarce resources. We present Tiny SESAME to meet these challenges while utilizing Jini™ technology from Sun Microsystems to handle the common parts of distributed devices. Tiny SESAME is a lightweight component-based, Java-implementation of a subset of SESAME. SESAME is an extension to Kerberos that supports public key technologies, access control, and delegation of access rights. We discuss our Tiny SESAME and how it could be integrated with handheld and consumer devices.},

This paper describes the development of a microprocessor controlled, pseudorandom code generator which will be used to drive the optical sources for the fiber optic sensors in the system. The design offers the flexibility of generating pseudorandom bit sequences (PRBS) using seed lengths from 2 to 16 bits, and has a programmable interface that allows the bit length and the initial seed value to be user defined. The system operates at 25 MHz with a programmable pulse repetition time (PRT). This work is being done in support of the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center in Annapolis, MD.},
