abstract = {Capecitabine (Ro 09‐1978) is a novel oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate that was rationally designed to generate 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) selectively in tumors. The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites was investigated in 11 patients with advanced colorectal cancer using a two‐way cross‐over design with randomized sequence. Patients received repeated doses of 666 or 1255 mg/m2 of capecitabine twice daily. On study days 1 and 8, drug was administered following an overnight fast or within 30 min after consumption of a standard breakfast, and serial blood samples were collected. Concentrations of capecitabine and its metabolites [5'‐deoxy‐5‐fluorocytidine (5'‐DFCR), 5'‐deoxy‐5‐fluorouridine (5'‐DFUR), 5‐FU, dihydro‐5‐fluorouracil (FUH2), and alpha‐fluoro‐beta‐alanine (FBAL)] in plasma were determined by high‐performance liquid chromatography or liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. Intake of food prior to the administration of capecitabine resulted in pharmacokinetic changes of all compounds involved. The extent of these changes, however, varied considerably between the various compounds. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration‐time curve (AUC) values were decreased after food, and time until the occurrence of Cmax values were increased. In contrast, the apparent elimination half‐life was not affected by food intake. The extent of change in Cmax and AUC was highest for capecitabine and decreased with the order of formation of the metabolites. The "before:after food" ratios of the Cmax values were 2.47 for capecitabine, 1.81 for 5'‐DFCR, 1.53 for 5'‐DFUR, 1.58 for 5‐FU, 1.26 for FUH2, and 1.11 for FBAL. The before: after food ratios of the AUC values were 1.51 for capecitabine, 1.26 for 5'‐DFCR, 1.15 for 5'‐DFUR, 1.13 for 5‐FU, 1.07 for FUH2, and 1.04 for FBAL. The results show that food has a profound effect on the AUC of capecitabine, a moderate effect on the AUC of 5'‐DFCR, and only a minor influence on the AUC of the other metabolites in plasma. In addition, a profound influence on Cmax of capecitabine and most of its metabolites was found. Detailed information on the relationship between concentration and safety/efficacy is necessary to evaluate the clinical significance of these pharmacokinetic findings. At present, it is recommended that capecitabine be administered with food as this procedure was used in the clinical trials.},

abstract = {Introduction: If it were detected at early stage of colorectal cancer, it could have a chance to cure. However, if it detected at far advanced stage when distant metastases are present, it becomes less likely to be curable. Metabolomics can profile metabolic changes that occur in living systems in response to various factors. Altered metabolic profiles may provide potential biomarkers for detection, staging, prognostication, and treatment of colorectal cancer. In this study, we want to know the metabolic profile differences between colorectal tissue and normal tissue Methods: Metabolites of advanced colorectal cancer tissues(TNM stage III & IV)from 30 patients were analyzed and compared with those from the normal tissues by two‐dimensional NMRspectroscopy.NMR data were analyzed with the help of the metabolite database and the statistics software. Cancerous tissues showed significantly altered metabolic profiles as compared to the normal tissue. Among such metabolites, the concentrations of taurine, glutamate, choline were increased in the cancerous tissues of most patients, and those of glucose, malate, and glycerol were decreased.The traditional chemometric analysis was also performed using AMIX software. We have shown that 2 dimensional HSQC spectra produced a more robust and reliable result than the method based on one‐dimensional spectra. Results: We have shown that 2 dimensional HSQC spectra produced a more robust and reliable result than the method based on one‐dimensional spectra. The PCA result from HSQC data showed a clearly separated groups corresponding to normal and cancerous tissues. This kind of diagnosis does not depend on finding a unique biomarker, but uses "common" metabolites and their concentrations as a whole. Conclusion: It was difficult to distinguish clear differences from normal tissues in colorectal cancer tissues and to identify biological markers that could be applied in clinical practice. We need more precise & randomized, large‐scale studies to get valuable biomarkers of the diagnosis and classification of colorectal cancers.},

abstract = {Lynch syndrome is the most common inherited CRC. It is an autosomal dominant disorder responsible for about 3% of newly diagnosed CRC. It is caused by germline mutation in one of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, MSH2, MHS6, PMS2) or loss of expression of MSH2 due to deletion in the EPCAM gene. These derangements result in a Micro‐ Satellite Instability (MSI) which is associated with a 70% lifetime risk of CRC in these patients. Effective interventions to reduce the risk of development of colorectal cancer are limited to surveillance and surgical prophylaxis. While patients with hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes have the highest risk of developing colorectal cancer, majority of chemoprevention trials are focused on sporadic CRC. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is associated with a higher risk of colon cancer. Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) is an omega‐3 fatty acid linked to reduction of PGE2 in colon tissue. EPA at 2 gram daily for 6 months given to patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) resulted in 22.4% reduction in adenoma number and 29.8% reduction in adenoma size. The efficacy of EPA as a chemopreventive agent in FAP has prompted the currently ongoing seAFOod Polyp Prevention Trial, a large placebo‐controlled, randomized trial of EPA in patients with a history of colorectal adenoma within the English Bowel Cancer Screening Program. Experimental studies have demonstrated that inflammation inactivates MMR function and increases mutation rates. PGE2 has been shown to silence DNA repair genes by enhancing DNA methylation to promote colonic tumor growth. A large retrospective analysis by Song et al showed that high marine omega‐3 PUFA intake is associated with lower risk of MSI‐high CRC, suggesting a potential role of omega‐3 PUFAs in protection against CRC through DNA MMR. Based on these findings and prior data showing a stronger inverse association of omega‐3 PUFA with proximal colon cancer, we hypothesize that marine omega‐3 PUFAs will more likely to inhibit inflammatory pathways associated with the development of tumors that arise from defective MMR. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published prospective trials that looked into the potential chemopreventive role of omega‐3 PUFA in lynch or MSI high colorectal cancer survivors. Finding an effective way to reduce the burden of CRC in this high risk population beyond screening colonoscopies and prophylactic surgery is an area of great unmet need. Supported by published EPA chemo‐preventive properties, we are proposing a prospective randomized placebo controlled pilot trial evaluating safety and feasibility of high dose fish oil in patients with lynch syndrome. We will investigate whether 12 months of EPA 2G po daily would result in bio‐molecular, metabolomics and intestinal microbiota changes consistent with chemopreventive efficacy. This will include biomarkers of carcinogenesis, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in blood, stool, and colonic tissue in this patient population.},

abstract = {SCOPE: Aim of the study was to identify and monitor metabolite markers of dry bean consumption in parallel human and mouse studies that each had shown chemopreventive effects of dry bean consumption on colorectal neoplasia risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using LC/mass spectroscopy ± ESI and GC/mass spectroscopy, serum metabolites of dry beans were measured in 46 men before and after a 4‐week dry bean enriched diet (250 g/day) and 12 mice that received a standardized diet containing either 0 or 10% navy bean ethanol extract for 6 weeks; we also investigated fecal metabolites in the mice. The serum metabolites identified in these controlled feeding studies were then investigated in 212 polyp‐free participants from the Polyp Prevention Trial who self‐reported either increased (≥+31 g/day from baseline), high dry bean intake of ≥42 g/day in year 3 or low, unchanged dry bean consumption of <8 g/day; serum was analyzed from baseline and year 3. Serum pipecolic acid and S‐methyl cysteine were elevated after dry bean consumption in human and mouse studies and reflected dry bean consumption in the Polyp Prevention Trial. CONCLUSION: Serum levels of pipecolic acid and S‐methyl cysteine are useful biomarkers of dry bean consumption.},

abstract = {METHODS: We conducted a serum metabolomic investigation of prostate cancer risk in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial that included annual serum total prostate‐specific antigen measurement and digital rectal examination. This nested study included 380 cases diagnosed post‐screening and 380 controls individually matched to cases on age, race, study centre, and blood‐collection date (median time to diagnosis, 10 years (range 4.4‐17 years)). Sera were analysed on a high‐resolution accurate mass platform of ultrahigh‐performance liquid and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy that identified 695 known metabolites. Logistic regression conditioned on the matching factors estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of risk associated with an 80th percentile increase in the log‐metabolite signal. RESULTS: Twenty‐seven metabolites were associated with prostate cancer at P<0.05. Pyroglutamine, gamma‐glutamylphenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, N‐acetylcitrulline, and stearoylcarnitine showed the strongest metabolite‐risk signals (ORs=0.53, 0.51, 0.46, 0.58, and 1.74, respectively; 0.001⩽P⩽0.006). Findings were similar for aggressive disease (peptide chemical class, P=0.03). None of the P‐values were below the threshold of Bonferroni correction, however. CONCLUSIONS: A unique metabolomic profile associated with post‐screening prostate cancer is identified that differs from that in a previously studied, unscreened population. BACKGROUND: Two recent metabolomic analyses found serum lipid, energy, and other metabolites related to aggressive prostate cancer risk up to 20 years prior to diagnosis.},

abstract = {PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated with irinotecan in a multicenter, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial. Eligible patients received irinotecan (350 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks) combined with neomycin (660 mg three times daily for three consecutive days, starting 2 days before chemotherapy) or combined with placebo. Blood samples were obtained for additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Sixty‐two patients were evaluable for the toxicity analysis. Baseline patient characteristics, systemic SN‐38 exposure, and UGT1A1*28 genotype status (i.e., an additional TA repeat in the promoter region of uridine diphosphate‐glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1) were similar in both arms. Although distribution, severity, and duration of delayed‐type diarrhea did not differ significantly between arms, grade 3 diarrhea tended to be less frequent in the neomycin arm. The presence of at least one UGT1A1*28 allele was strongly related to the incidence of grade 2‐3 diarrhea. In the neomycin arm, grade 2 nausea was significantly more common. CONCLUSION: Our results do not suggest a major role for neomycin as prophylaxis for irinotecan‐induced delayed‐type diarrhea. It is suggested that the UGT1A1*28 genotype status could be used as a screening tool for a priori prevention of irinotecan‐induced delayed‐type diarrhea. OBJECTIVE: Delayed‐type diarrhea is a common side effect of irinotecan and is associated with a bacterial‐mediated formation of the active irinotecan metabolite SN‐38 from its glucuronide conjugate in the intestine. Based on a pilot study, we hypothesized that concomitant administration of the antibiotic neomycin would diminish exposure of the gut to SN‐38 and ameliorate the incidence and severity of diarrhea.},

abstract = {Obesity is estimated to explain 15‐20% of all cancer deaths in the U.S. Our current understanding of the mechanisms involved is only partial, especially for the two most common obesity‐related cancers (breast and colorectal), and has not led to effective interventions. As the current obesity epidemic continues unabated, particularly among the poor and lower middle class, it is feared that the recent progress in lowering cancer rates and in improving the nation's health may be reversed, and health disparities worsened. Evidence suggests that the main U.S. ethnic/racial populations not only have different mean levels of body mass index (BMI) but also varying patterns of fat distribution. Compared to whites, African Americans experience a higher prevalence of obesity, with greater amounts of superficial abdominal subcutaneous fat which carries a lower metabolic risk than visceral fat or deep subcutaneous fat. In contrast, Asians have lower total adiposity but more visceral fat and experience higher rates of metabolic diseases. Hispanics have more overall and visceral adiposity and Native Hawaiians have high obesity rates; both groups are also at high risk for metabolic diseases. This heterogeneity in BMI levels and types of obesity existing among these 5 ethnic groups represented in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) offers a unique setting to study obesity and cancer. Similarly, the marked differences observed in the incidence of obesity‐related cancers among the five ethnic/racial groups in the MEC reflect those described by SEER in their source populations. In addition, we observed striking ethnic/racial differences in the BMI‐cancer association. For example, for breast cancer, the association was strongest for Native Hawaiians and Japanese Americans and occurred starting at low levels of excess BMI (>25 kg/m2). In contrast, the association in the other groups occurred only at high BMI levels (>30 kg/m2), if at all. A similar pattern was seen for colorectal cancer and diabetes. We interpret these differences as supporting an important role for body fat distribution, in addition to amount, in determining cancer risk. This has been suggested by a number of studies that assessed central obesity with waist and hip measurements. However, there is a critical need for a more comprehensive study of body fat distribution patterns (assessed by reference imaging methods) in U.S. ethnic/racial minorities and their association with cancer risks. We have initiated a large study within the MEC that will: 1) describe amount and distribution of body fat among older adults of five major U.S. ethnic/racial populations using whole body DXA and abdominal MRI; 2) identify nutritional, behavioral, biochemical, hormonal, genetic, metabolomic and gut microbiome determinants of these fat distribution patterns; 3) investigate inter‐relationships among these factors to better understand the causes of obesity; 4) build integrated predictive signatures for these body fat compartments; and 5) test prospectively these predictive signatures for associations with breast and colorectal cancer risks in the MEC.},

However, fecal‐based methods identify patients with adenomatous polyps with low levels of sensitivity. The aim or this study was to develop a highly accurate, prototypic, proof‐of‐concept, spot urine‐based diagnostic test using metabolomic technology to distinguish persons with adenomatous polyps from those without polyps. Methods: Prospective urine and stool samples were collected from 876 participants undergoing colonoscopy examination in a colon cancer screening program, from April 2008 to October 2009 at the University of Alberta. Colonoscopy reference standard identified 633 participants with no colonic polyps and 243 with colonic adenomatous polyps. One‐dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of urine metabolites were analyzed to define a diagnostic metabolomic profile for colonic adenomas. A urine metabolomic diagnostic test for colonic adenomatous polyps was established using 67% of the samples (un‐blinded training set) and validated using the other 33% of the samples (blinded testing set). The urine metabolomic diagnostic test's specificity and sensitivity were compared with those of fecal‐based tests. Results: Using a two‐component, orthogonal, partial least‐squares model of the metabolomic profile, the un‐blinded training set identified patients with colonic adenomatous polyps with 88.9% sensitivity and 50.2% specificity. Validation using the blinded testing set confirmed sensitivity and specificity values of 82.7% and 51.2%, respectively. Sensitivities of fecal‐based tests to identify colonic adenomas ranged from 2.5 to 11.9%. Conclusions: We describe a proof‐of‐concept spot urine‐based metabolomic diagnostic test that identifies patients with colonic adenomatous polyps with a greater level of sensitivity (83%) than fecal‐based tests. 2014 the American College of Gastroenterology.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type in males and the second in females, accounting for about 693,900 deaths worldwide per year. Although the annual CRC mortality rate is still very high, it demonstrated a decline by 47% among men and 44% among women from 1990 to 2015. This decreasing trend may be attributed to improved screening, early detection as well as combined CRC treatment. In fact, the mortality rate is expected to reduce further by long‐term use of chemopreventive agents that can prevent the development of neoplasms in the large bowel. Several decades of research both in clinic and laboratory has identified aspirin as an effective synthetic CRC chemoprevention drug. It is commonly accepted that aspirin exerts its chemopreventive effects by inhibiting catalytic enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX) ‐1 and COX‐2 involved in prostaglandin synthesis. But the mechanism of its chemopreventive effect on CRC is not clearly understood. Other than CRC, aspirin also showed its potential inhibitory effects on some other types of solid cancer, such as pancreatic, lung, breast and prostate cancers. However, its effects on extragastrointestinal cancer types are still elusive due to lack of reliable supporting evidence from randomized clinical trials. Based on current knowledge, it is unclear why aspirin appears to inhibit CRC more than other cancers. This might be associated with the unique microenvironment comprising trillions of microbes in which CRC resides.},

abstract = {Purpose: Sirolimus is the prototypical mTOR inhibitor. Sorafenib and sunitinib are small molecule inhibitors of multiple kinases including VEGF receptor (VEGFR) kinases. These agents have different mechanisms of action, providing a strong rationale for combination. Experimental Design: Patients with advanced cancer were assigned to receive either sirolimus or the VEGFR inhibitor alone for a 2‐week lead‐in period, followed by combination therapy. The primary end point of each trial was to determine whether a drug interaction exists between sirolimus and either sorafenib or sunitinib, as defined by a difference in Cmax for each drug alone compared with its C max during combination therapy. Results: The sorafenib and sunitinib trials enrolled 34 and 23 patients, respectively. There were no clinically significant differences in Cmax for any of the drugs alone compared with the Cmax during combination therapy. Toxicity profiles were similar to those expected for each drug alone. One patient with adrenal cortical cancer had a partial response to sirolimus and sunitnib. Conclusions: Sirolimus can be safely combined with sorafenib or sunitinib. Our trial design is feasible and informative in screening for potential drug‐drug interactions, using a relatively small number of patients and limited pharmacokinetic sampling. 2011 AACR.},
